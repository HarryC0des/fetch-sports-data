    "content_html": "Golden State Warriors forward Jimmy Butler suffered a torn ACL in Monday's 135-112 win over the Miami Heat. His season is over.Butler's agent, Bernie Lee, confirmed the injury Tuesday. Lee called it a \"gut punch\" and said Butler would \"attack this challenge\" hoping to come back stronger. The Warriors also confirmed the injury later Tuesday and announced that Butler would undergo surgery at a \"to-be-determined date.\"Butler, meanwhile, posted on Instagram stating he would \"be back before you know it.\" [Get more Warriors news: Golden State team team feed]The injury took place in the third quarter at the Chase Center after Butler caught a contested pass in the paint. Butler landed awkwardly on his right leg and fell to the ground after contact from Davion Mitchell drew a foul. Butler writhed on the court and clutched his right knee after sustaining the injury.

They later said Butler would undergo an MRI and didn't reveal any information about the severity of the injury.\"Praying for the best, as far as scans,\" Warriors guard Stephen Curry said, according to ESPN's Anthony Slater.Overnight Tuesday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported Butler was dealing with a torn ACL.Butler previously had two significant injuries to same knee earlier in his career: a meniscus tear in 2018 and an MCL sprain in 2024. Big blow for Butler, WarriorsButler, a five-time All-NBA selection, is in his second season with the Warriors following a midseason trade from the Heat in 2024-25. The Warriors acquired Butler in an effort to compete for another championship on the back end of Stephen Curry's prime. Butler's maintained his high level of play at 36 years old. In 37 games before Monday's, Butler was averaging 20.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.4 steals per game while shooting 51.9% from the field and 38.1% from 3. Curry, meanwhile, is averaging 27.6 points per game and leads the league for an 11th time with 4.5 made 3s per game on 38.6% shooting. He was named an All-Star starter earlier Monday.With Butler and Curry leading the team, the Warriors now hold a 25-19 record, good for eighth place the Western Conference. Butler's ACL tear projects to end any previous long-shot hope of Golden State competing in the West and could impact how the approach the trade market ahead of the Feb. 5 deadline.",

    "description": "A day after the Knicks All-Stars responded to boos at MSG, news broke that Brunson called a players only meeting to address a 2-9 slump.",
    "content_html": "A New York Knicks skid reached what fans can only hope is its nadir Monday in a blowout loss to the hapless Dallas Mavericks at home. This once again — and repeatedly — led to boos from the crowd at Madison Square Garden. And, per ESPN's Ramona Shelburne, it prompted team captain Jalen Brunson to call a players only meeting after the loss. Per the report, Brunson emphasized in the meeting that Knicks players need to look to themselves rather than coach Mike Brown and his staff to fix the problems that have resulted in a 2-9 slump in their last 11 games on the heels of winning the NBA Cup in mid-December. The slump has led to frustration in the locker and among a vocal Knicks fan base.On Monday, boos started to rain from the MSG stands in the second quarter after the Mavericks built a 49-31 lead. The Knicks previously heard boos from the home crowd in the fourth quarter of Saturday's 106-99 loss to the Phoenix Suns. For the second straight night the Knicks hear loud boos from the MSG crowd. pic.twitter.com/EhWBDKCios— KNICKS BEAST (@KnicksBeast) January 19, 2026The Knicks did not respond well to Monday's boos. The Mavericks remained in control of the game en route to a 114-97 win to improve to 18-26, good for 12th place in the West.The slump for the Knicks has dropped them from a 23-9 start to 25-18. That's good enough for third place in the East. But the Knicks are now closer in the standings to the 11th-place Milwaukee Bucks (18-24) than they are to the first-place Detroit Pistons (31-10). And they ended Monday 1.5 games behind the much-loathed Boston Celtics (26-16).Jalen Brunson: 'I'd be booing us too'Brunson and fellow All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns both heard the boos — obviously. And they understand. Brunson finished Monday with 22 points and six assists. But he struggled from the field in a 9-of-22 shooting effort. He was asked about the boos at his locker room postgame.\"I'd be booing us too,\" Brunson said. \"Straight up.\"\"I'd be booing us too. Straight up\"- Jalen Brunson on the boos at MSG pic.twitter.com/XtnkiHkqOT— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 20, 2026Towns posted the best effort by a Knick with 22 points and 18 rebounds, but he committed a team-high five turnovers and five fouls. And he's posted a few duds of his own during the slump, including a six-point, one-rebound effort in a 121-90 loss to the Pistons on Jan. 5.Like Brunson, he understands the boos. And he put himself in the perspective of a fan paying to attend Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day matinee. Karl-Anthony Towns on the boos at MSG directed at him and the team\"You spend $140 to represent your favorite player with a jersey. You come to MLK Day here at The Garden and tickets are 3x the price. I'd be disappointed too\" pic.twitter.com/vrTAznt1mV— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 20, 2026\"You come, you spend, what $140 bucks to represent your favorite player with a jersey?\" Towns said. \"And you come to MLK Day here at the Garden and tickets are twice, three times the price?\"And to come here and spend your hard-earned money, money that you've saved up to bring your family to this game and for us to come here and obviously, not only [not] win — which is disappointing — but not really have a chance. I'd be disappointed, too.\"The fans who spend their hard-earned money, they give us so much love and motivation to go out there. They expect the results. And so do we. The fans are doing their part. And we've got to do our part.\"If there's any solace for frustrated Knicks fans, it's that those are the exact kind of responses you want to hear from star players who just got booed off their home court for another poor showing. But that won't stop the boos. Only winning will.",

    "link": "https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/what-does-losing-jimmy-butler-mean-for-the-warriors-as-we-know-them-220033863.html",
    "description": "Golden State&#39;s best-laid plans have gone up in smoke. Is it finally time for a hard reset?",
    "content_html": "Adding Jimmy Butler fundamentally changed who the Warriors were last season — the way they played, the heights they could aspire to, their chances of playing meaningful basketball deep into springtime once again. Losing Butler on Monday to a torn right ACL — a devastating blow that sapped every ounce of sweetness out of Golden State’s fourth consecutive double-digit win — fundamentally changes who the Warriors are this season, and threatens a devastating alteration to who they could conceivably still be in the “fading dynasty” stage of the Stephen Curry/Draymond Green/Steve Kerr era.Let’s start with the obvious: It is extremely, extremely damaging to lose a player as good as Butler, whose teams have either outright won or been demonstrably better in his minutes in every season save the one where he was trying to force his way out of Minnesota.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Even at age 36, a crisp 15 years and nearly 35,000 NBA minutes into his career, Butler remains one of the league’s best all-around players — a high-efficiency, low-mistake offensive connector; a versatile and disruptive defender; a high-IQ adaptor able to fit neatly into the flow when playing alongside Curry and scale up into a larger, more central role when Steph’s off the floor; a consistently high-floor contributor with few peers at his position.(Grant Thomas/Yahoo Sports illutration)Butler is second on the Warriors in scoring, third in assists and rebounds, and leads them in steals and total minutes played. There are four players in the NBA this season averaging at least 20 points, five rebounds, four assists and a steal per game while making at least half of their shots: Butler, perennial MVP favorite Nikola Jokić, and ascendant All-Star-caliber bigs Alperen Şengün and Jalen Johnson.The advanced stats, as ever, love him: He’s been a top-15-to-20 player this season in the eyes of estimated plus-minus, LEBRON, DARKO, value over replacement player, player efficiency rating, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus-minus and regularized adjusted plus-minus, among other metrics. The Warriors have been 9.6 points per 100 possessions better with Butler on the court than off it this season, according to Cleaning the Glass; among players who’ve logged 1,000 minutes, that’s the 10th-largest on/off swing in the NBA.Butler had averaged just under 22-5-5 on pristine .649 true shooting over the past month prior to exiting early against Miami. He was playing some of the best ball of his career, and with it, the Warriors had started to stabilize: Golden State has won four straight and 12 of its last 16, with the NBA’s second-best record and fifth-best net rating in that span.During that period, the Warriors have outscored opponents by 8.4 points per 100 possessions with Butler on the floor, compared to a plus-4.4 net rating without him. That includes a mammoth plus-12.9 net rating in the 183 minutes that Butler played without Curry, continuing the trend that began last season of Golden State finally being able to not only survive non-Steph minutes, but sometimes actually build a lead while he rested. (Imagine that.)Only one Warriors five-man lineup without Butler in it has played more than 20 minutes together this season; the quintet of Curry, Green, Gary Payton II, Brandin Podziemski and Moses Moody has been outscored by 13 points. That, um, will need to change — as will the general tenor of the non-Steph minutes, which, with Butler lost for the season, threaten to return to disaster time. The Warriors have been outscored by 3.9 points-per-100 this season with neither Curry nor Butler on the floor, posting a dismal non-garbage-time offensive rating of just 105.2 — several sub-basements below what the league-worst attack of the Tyrese Haliburton-less 10-34 Pacers has mustered over the course of this season.Combine that with the degree to which Golden State had struggled to tread water in non-Jimmy minutes even with Steph on the floor — just plus-1.1 points-per-100 over nearly 500 minutes this season — and the Warriors have a pretty gnarly puzzle to solve over the second half of the season if they hope to have any chance of remaining in postseason position.Golden State enters Tuesday’s game against the Toronto Raptors at 25-19, in eighth place in the Western Conference — in line for their third straight trip to the play-in tournament. With Butler in the fold and playing at an All-Star level, Kerr, general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Co. could reasonably harbor hopes of erasing the two-game gap between them and the fifth-place Houston Rockets, putting themselves in position to not only avoid the play-in but potentially challenge for home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs. Now, though, the Warriors braintrust now has to consider whether it’s likelier that they rise or fall — they’re three games ahead of ninth-place Portland, five games up on the 10th-place Clippers, and 5.5 clear of 11th-place Memphis — and how their internal projections will inform their decision-making ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline.Five days past the NBA’s most closely watched trade eligibility date, Jonathan Kuminga remains a member of the Warriors. Twenty-four hours ago, it seemed likely that Dunleavy would keep beating the bushes in search of a deal that could turn the out-of-favor 23-year-old into something, anything, that could improve the Warriors’ chances of making a deep playoff run. But with Golden State now in desperate need of a wing-sized person capable of putting the ball in the basket, even if it’s not in precisely the way Kerr prefers, and with the most frequently stated reason for shelving Kuminga — effectively, we can’t play three not-really-shooters who need the ball in their hands, and Jimmy and Draymond are better than Kuminga is — does that calculus change?If and when Kerr turns back to Kuminga — which he didn’t on Monday, but which he said could happen in the days and weeks ahead — how might the fifth-year forward respond? It seems like an awful lot, asking someone who has essentially been out of the rotation for two months to suddenly start replicating the production of a top-20 player — especially considering lineups where he’s had to carry the offensive workload without Steph or Jimmy have gotten drilled over the past two seasons. If a reintroduced Kuminga struggles under these adverse conditions, does it become even more difficult to move him for a return of noteworthy value? And if he doesn’t — if he looks great — well, then what do you do with a guy you’ve signaled in every way possible that you’re ready to drive to the airport at the earliest opportunity, but who’s suddenly become a load-bearing column in your current build?The $11 billion question hanging over all of this, in the hours after Butler’s grim diagnosis: Just what is that “current build,” now?The premise behind the Butler trade and subsequent extension was clean, clear and evident to all who observed it. Golden State had lined up the contracts of Curry, Butler and Green to take aim at a title run in 2024-25 and 2025-26, with a possible third in 2026-27, when Green holds a $27.7 million player option. It was an unmistakable declaration of intent: As long as we have Steph playing LIKE THIS, we’re going to go for it.And it worked, and it looked great … until it didn’t. The first run ended in the second round, after Steph hurt his hamstring against the Timberwolves; with Butler’s season now over, the second one appears to have ended before it could even get started. And now, the Warriors find themselves back where they were this time last year: with Curry still playing like this, but without a supporting cast commensurate with the frankly unbelievable level at which he continues to produce.Maybe that gives the rest of Golden State’s roster short shrift. De’Anthony Melton is finally healthy again and playing great. Al Horford’s starting to show signs of coming around. Podziemski’s in the midst of his best run of play of the season. Moody and Buddy Hield are shooting better than 40% from 3-point land over the last month. Maybe they keep rolling, and Kerr’s able to find enough contributions from elsewhere — from rookie Will Richard, from Quinten Post, from Trayce Jackson-Davis, and on, and on — to keep the Warriors in the fight, where they’re forever one Curry flurry from delivering a knockout blow.And maybe the injury doesn’t necessarily preclude one last big comeback run. The average return-to-play following an ACL tear is about 11 months, according to Jeff Stotts of In Street Clothes; that would put Butler’s return somewhere around Christmas, meaning he’d miss roughly the first quarter of the 2026-27 season, giving Golden State a lot of runway to get up to full strength before mid-April. Maybe there are still two real bites at the apple here.Maybe, though, Butler’s injury shakes the Warriors’ faith in the viability of that timeline — in the likelihood that, 14 months from now, a core of a 39-year-old Curry, a 37-year-old Green and a 37-year-old, post-ACL-reconstruction Butler will be good enough to win in the playoffs. If Dunleavy and Co. arrive at that conclusion, they’ll have to decide whether they’re comfortable continuing to ride what they’ve got into the sunset — appreciating that time comes for us all, that best-laid plans sometimes go awry, and that it’s worth allowing the Steph-Draymond-Jimmy core to run its course — or if it’s time to make even more drastic changes to the roster, in service of seeding the ground for the next era of Warriors basketball, whenever that might start.The former path would be perfectly respectable, if not downright honorable. In a world that’s seen the Warriors try to pull off the two timelines plan and let Klay Thompson walk, though, the latter can’t be ruled out. I don’t think that means they’re going to trade Steph in the middle of the night. (Although, y’know: Luka.) I do think, though, it means that just about anything else could be on the table, one fundamental change begetting another.",

    "description": "With the NBA trade deadline two weeks away, let&#39;s sort through the players who have reportedly been in trade talks.",
    "content_html": "Welcome back to the world’s most accurate power rankings, where this week, before the Feb. 5 trade deadline, we are adding a wrinkle, rating 25 “available” NBA players from worst to first.Just how “available” they are is in some question. Giannis Antetokounmpo, for example, may want out, but until he formally requests a trade, the Milwaukee Bucks will be hesitant to grant him one. Others are readily available. Some may only be parted with for the right asking price.But all of them make some sense as trade candidates, given their situations. So, here we are to sort them based upon their talent, their contracts, their fits, their everything. Mostly: Can any of them meaningfully change a team’s championship chances? Here we try to sort them in order, mostly, based on how much each could alter this year’s title picture. Surely you will not argue.(Taylor Wilhelm/Yahoo Sports Illustration)One more thing before we get to the rankings: Karl-Anthony Towns. Is he available? Whispers are growing louder, if only because his New York Knicks are struggling. But I still cannot imagine a world in which the Knicks disrupt their roster — one that remains a favorite to emerge from the East — for anyone but Antetokounmpo. So we will leave him sidelined for now.Honorable mentions: Cam Thomas, Brooklyn Nets; Chris Paul, Los Angeles Clippers; De’Andre Hunter, Cleveland Cavaliers; Malik Monk; Sacramento Kings.25. Jonathan Kuminga, Golden State WarriorsOn Thursday, Kuminga demanded a trade from the Warriors. On Friday, we discussed whether he was even a good basketball player. On Monday, Golden State’s Jimmy Butler tore his right ACL, leaving open a massive hole on the wing. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was asked if he will turn to Kuminga, and in a disheartened voice he said, “Sure. Absolutely.” Audition time, I guess?24. Immanuel Quickley, Toronto RaptorsThe Raptors have canvassed the market, shopping “some of their players, including RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley,” looking to see what value they might find, according to ESPN. Among their reported potential targets are Anthony Davis and Ja Morant. Why a trade partner would want the three years and $97.5 million left on Quickley’s deal is a question to which it would need answers.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]23. Kristaps Porziņģis, Atlanta HawksThe Hawks, along with the Raptors, are reportedly among the teams that remain interested in the services of Davis, even after a hand injury that could sideline him through the All-Star break. Any Hawks trade for a high-priced star would have to include the $30.7 million expiring contract for Porziņģis, whose health remains a concern. Get him on the court, though, and he would help.22. Anfernee Simons, Boston CelticsOver the summer, Boston was “still very much willing to talk about Simons” in trade discussions, per longtime Celtics insider Steve Bulpett, even after acquiring the former Blazers guard in July. It makes sense, given Simons’ expiring $27.7 million salary. Boston has two reasons to shop him: 1) to duck the luxury tax or 2) to roll that salary forward for a surprisingly competitive roster. 21. Nikola Vučević, Chicago BullsBecause Vučević is on an expiring $21.5 million salary, longtime trade speculation has only rampedup this season, and Vučević himself might even want a change in scenery. To that end, Bulls coach Billy Donovan said, “I do think he’s invested and committed.” Which may make him even more tradable. The Bulls hold enough expiring money to pursue Davis, a local product.20. Jalen Green, Phoenix SunsWhile Green has not been mentioned in any well-sourced trade rumors, the Suns would almost certainly have to include his $33.6 million salary in any discussion of upgrades to a team fighting for a guaranteed playoff seed in the West. The former No. 2 overall pick has shown flashes as a 20-point scorer, though his defense and an ongoing hamstring injury are reasons for concern. 19. Herb Jones, New Orleans PelicansHerb Jones and Trey Murphy III are among the names the Pelicans are not willing to discuss ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline, per Chris Haynes. But teams will continue to call, so long as New Orleans remains at the bottom of the standings. Jones, a 3-and-D wing who has shot 32% from distance over the past two seasons, signed a three-year, $67.6 million extension in July. 18. DeMar DeRozan, Sacramento KingsThe NBA’s worst-keptsecret: Everyone on the Kings, including Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, are available in a trade, particularly as Sacramento pursues another headliner. The Kings could even be open to a DeRozan-for-Morant swap, so long as it does not cost them much more than Devin Carter, but is that enough to convince Memphis?17. Zach LaVine, Sacramento KingsAs with DeRozan, there is no secret about LaVine’s availability via trade. He is owed $49 million next season, when he will turn 32 years old. He has played four playoff games in 12 years. He has always been an efficient 20-point scorer, even if he cannot defend well and commits almost as many turnovers as he registers assists. It only makes sense that his contract is up for grabs.16. RJ Barrett, Toronto RaptorsLike Quickley, Barrett’s salary — $27.7 million this season and $29.6 million next season — makes for an intriguing match in Toronto’s pursuit of an upgrade, which is another reason why he has been linked to rumors surrounding both Davis and Morant. Barrett holds some value on his own, as the 25-year-old has averaged a fairly efficient 20-5-4 for the fourth-place Raptors.15. Coby White, Chicago BullsRival executives are circling the Bulls, according to ESPN’s Jamal Collier, and they may be more open to trading White’s expiring $12.9 million salary than ever before, per Substack insider Marc Stein. Of course, White is owed a potentially costly contract extension at season’s end. The Wolves are reportedly among the teams weighing whether that juice is worth the squeeze.14. Jarrett Allen, Cleveland CavaliersGiven the mix in Cleveland, with Evan Mobley emerging as a force in the middle, we have long wondered whether Allen would be long for the Cavaliers. Trade consideration subsided last season, as the Cavs won 64 games, but ever since they lost another second-round playoff series and started this season in search of a playoff guarantee, speculation has only resurfaced.13. Tyler Herro, Miami HeatMiami will be linked to whatever superstar becomes available, including if and when the Bucks decide to entertain sweepstakes for Giannis Antetokounmpo. One of the few assets the Heat can offer in return is Herro, a 26-year-old, one-time All-Star and former Sixth Man of the Year. He is owed $33 million in 2026-27. How enticing that is to a team trading a superstar is in question. 12. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets“Ball has grown increasingly frustrated with the organization and is open to a trade away from the franchise,” according to Yahoo Sports’ Kelly Iko. Of course, Ball denied this publicly, saying, “The source wasn’t me, so it’s false info,” though reports ever since have maintained that rival executives are operating under the assumption that Ball is available. Does anyone want him?11. Darius Garland, Cleveland CavaliersAs is the case with Allen in the frontcourt, there is a logjam in Cleveland’s backcourt, where Donovan Mitchell is the premier option. Garland’s impact is somewhat redundant, and the Cavs might be looking to make better sense of their roster. For those interested, though, Substack’s Jake Fischer insists, “I just haven’t heard any credible rumblings about Garland’s availability.”10. Austin Reaves, Los Angeles LakersCredit Lakers superstar LeBron James’ agent, Rich Paul, for entering Reaves’ name into the trade discussion, as he proposed a swap of the Lakers’ 27-year-old guard for Jaren Jackson Jr. Paul is not wrong, either, as Reaves could be owed a near-max contract at season’s end, and any quest for a star partner to James and Luka Dončić would require Reaves’ services in return. 9. Domantas Sabonis, Sacramento KingsAgain: No secret has been made about the availability of Sabonis, LaVine and DeRozan. The Kings are looking to mix things up, once again, and if it costs them their best players, so be it. It is not like Sacramento is winning anything as currently constituted. And Sabonis is capable of a triple-double on any given night, although his defense might dissuade most potential suitors.8. Zion Williamson, New Orleans PelicansWilliamson is among the names the Pelicans have been unwilling to shop, Haynes reported, though he may be the most likely of New Orleans’ targets to be traded, per The Athletic’s William Guillory. The Wizards are reportedly on the list of teams that could be interested at the right price. The right price for the oft-injured forward, though, may not be what the Pels want.7. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies“Everybody in here who knows me, knows I’m a very loyal guy,” insisted Morant. “I got a logo on my back, and that should tell you where I want to be.” Of course, based on everything else we have heard, Morant no longer wants to be on the Grizzlies, and they no longer want him, either. As anticipated, multiple suitors have emerged for Morant, including Miami, though at what cost?6. Trey Murphy III, New Orleans PelicansAnd again: Murphy is among the names New Orleans has been unwilling to discuss. Still, “not completely no on Trey, but a pretty high price tag,” according to The Athletic’s Sam Amick. And it makes complete sense. Murphy (22-6-4 on near 50/40/90 shooting splits) is the exact kind of 3-and-D wing, with the potential for more to his game, that any rival team would want to acquire.5. Michael Porter Jr., Brooklyn NetsIt is unclear how much the Warriors’ reported interest in Porter has changed in the wake of Butler’s injury, as it was even unclear how much Golden State was interested anyhow. Detroit has discussed the idea of dealing for Porter, according to Fischer. We have seen Porter win a title. Surely another contender can convince itself he can help them win, too.4. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesAs the market for Morant unfolds, “there’s a growing thought [among rival executives] that Jackson … could be the next domino to fall at some point,” according to Iko. That thought is widely held about the NBA’s 2023 Defensive Player of the Year. What need would Memphis have for Jackson if the franchise is, as reported, seeking a future-focused package for Morant?3. Anthony Davis, Dallas MavericksDavis’ most recent injury muddied the waters of his trade market, as has every injury he has sustained throughout his career. Atlanta and Toronto both appear to still be interested, but “the cost is most certainly going to be lower than it was even a month ago,” per ESPN’s Shams Charania. Which is why it may be in the best interest of Dallas and Davis to keep the status quo.2. Lauri Markkanen, Utah JazzIt was thought a long shot that Markkanen would remain a member of the Jazz, but Utah exec Austin Ainge insisted that the Finnish forward “hopefully is part of our next team when we’re going up.” Keyonte George’s emergence gives Ainge further reason to believe in a come-up, so any trade of Markkanen would surely cost his suitor “an arm and a leg in years of draft capital.” 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee BucksFunny thing about Giannis. He might want out. “I don’t know,” he said most recently, “I take it day by day.” He should want out, since his Bucks are bound for the lottery. But he does not want to ask out, for fear of alienating the fans in Milwaukee, per Collier. So maybe he will let his agent do his bidding. In which case, the league will line up for his services. This is Giannis, after all.",

    "content_html": "Who has been the MVP of the league at the season’s halfway point? Who’s winning the Rookie of the Year race? With every team hitting the 41-game mark, let’s hand out midseason awards.Midseason Most Valuable PlayerMidseason Rookie of the YearMidseason Coach of the YearMidseason Defensive Player of the YearMidseason Sixth Man of the YearMidseason Most Improved Player(Mallory Bielecki/Yahoo Sports Illustration)The Midseason MVP is ...Dan Devine: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder, for many of the same reasons he won last year. Take your pick: the best player on the best team; historically elite individual production that lines up pretty neatly next to Michael Jordan; the driving force behind what profiles as one of the greatest teams of all time; the primary reason OKC has a 5.5-game lead on the rest of the West; the most valuable clutch contributor in the league; first or second in nearly every advanced stat known to NBA nerdkind; and has played 10 more games and about 300 more minutes than Nikola Jokić. It’s a pretty strong damn case.Tom Haberstroh: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Injuries to the other four major candidates — Nikola Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Dončić and Victor Wembanyama — have paved the way for the reigning MVP to repeat. I think Cade Cunningham could make a late-season push, but it’s Gilgeous-Alexander’s award to lose. He’s the best player on the best team and has established himself as the game’s top clutch assassin, scoring a league-high 122 points with the score within five points in the final five minutes.Steve Jones: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The debate will rage on down the stretch, but with an injury to Jokić, the Bucks fighting to get into the play-in and the Lakers slipping down the Western Conference standings, it feels like it’s clearly Gilgeous-Alexander. The consistency he’s brought on the offensive end has continued to power the Thunder to the top of the standings. It will be intriguing to see how hard Cunningham, Wembanyama and Jaylen Brown start to knock on the door. Morten Stig Jensen: Nikola Jokić, Nuggets. Gilgeous-Alexander has played in 10 more games so far, but that advantage isn't quite enough, in my eyes, to overtake Jokić's season. That will change, however, should Joker miss a significant portion of games throughout the rest of the season. If not by him becoming ineligible, then because Gilgeous-Alexander is playing so well that a games-played gap justifies him. Kelly Iko: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Joker can miss only six more games before he’s ineligible due to the 65-game rule — and Cunningham would have a decent argument in any other season (26/10/6 on a team that should win 65 games) — but it’s SGA’s to lose. He’s averaging the highest points per shot attempt of any guard over the past decade (only Steph Curry comes close), OKC has a bottom-five offense without him, and his latest trick — dragging a Thunder team down its starting center and second-leading scorer across the finish line with the NBA’s best record — should be the icing on the cake. The Midseason Rookie of the Year is ...Iko: Cooper Flagg, Mavericks. He still has a ways to go in the efficiency department, but we’re talking about a 19-year-old posting 19/6/4 on a middling Mavericks team. That Dallas is within striking distance of the play-in is remarkable. Flagg has been asked to initiate offense, finish possessions, and defend multiple positions — and he’s taken those challenges with confidence. He’ll need to get to a point where he’s not a sub-30% 3-point shooter, but he’s done enough this season to warrant the award. Kon Knueppel has been awesome, though. Haberstroh: Kon Knueppel, Hornets. What a revelation. Think Klay Thompson or Khris Middleton — but with a higher ceiling. He’s a year and a half older than his former Duke mate Cooper Flagg, so in a sense it’s not too surprising that Knueppel has been more NBA-ready than the No. 1 overall pick. The Hornets found their franchise cornerstone.Devine: Kon Knueppel. He leads the rookie class in scoring on pretty shocking shooting efficiency — 56% on 2s, 43.5% on 3s, 89.4% at the charity stripe. As impressive, in my eyes: The 20-year-old has more than kept the Hornets afloat even in the significant amount of floor time he’s played without load-bearing offensive pieces LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Flagg’s been largely fantastic in a tough set of circumstances in Dallas; ditto for Cedric Coward in Memphis; and VJ Edgecombe has fit brilliantly in in Philly. But Knueppel’s walked into the NBA shooting like an all-time-great marksman, and helped elevate the Hornets to within arm’s reach of the play-in tournament.Jones: Cooper Flagg. It’s hard to ignore the corner Flagg has turned this season and the consistent aggression and confidence he’s brought to the table. Despite the tough start, Flagg leads the Mavericks in total points, rebounds, assists and steals, which speaks to his responsibility on a nightly basis. Flagg has a great feel for when and how to get to his spots. And while Kon Knueppel has been great, Flagg has overcome his circumstances to impact the game every night. Jensen: Cooper Flagg, by a freaking hair. This one is far from over, folks. We have a legit Rookie of the Year race on our hands between Flagg and Knueppel, who looks as if he's going to be one of the league's primary shooters for the next decade-plus. Every ROY race is welcome around these parts, so the fact that we aren't seeing someone run away with this thing yet is extremely enticing. [Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]The Midseason Coach of the Year is ...Jones: J.B. Bickerstaff, Pistons. One of the more underrated skills for a coach to have is to understand the talent you have, maximize it and get the entire roster to buy in. Bickerstaff has been able to do that, keeping Detroit at the top of the East. The great play of Cunningham is one thing, the growth of Jalen Duren is another, but when you go through the roster you see an identity where everyone contributes. This team defends and believes every night, and whatever expectation you had has been exceeded to this point. Jensen: Mitch Johnson, Spurs. Victor Wembanyama has been in and out of the lineup, and Johnson is relying heavily on a three-guard rotation consisting primarily of players who aren't strong natural shooters. Devin Vassell has also missed time, and when he's played his influence has been somewhat average. Yet the Spurs are winning despite all of that. This group has fully embraced a team-first mentality, and that doesn't happen without a high level of quality in the leadership department. Devine: Jordan Ott, Suns. Everyone’s on their best behavior at media day: swearing that it’s going to develop a culture of relentlessness competitiveness that hinges on accountability and the non-negotiability of playing hard. Everyone says that stuff. The Suns are actually doing it, though — eighth in points allowed per possession, second in steals, third in deflections, tied for fourth in loose balls recovered, fifth in offensive rebound rate, sixth in how frequently they dial up full-court pressure, etc. — and they’re reaping the benefits, sitting at 26-17. The Suns needed a full-tilt spiritual reset in the worst way; Ott has brought it from Day 1.Iko: Mitch Johnson. The Suns have been a revelation and Ott has been at its epicenter, but what Johnson has done is simply too incredible to downplay. I was present when Johnson was introduced by Gregg Popovich and outlined his plan to improve the Spurs on both sides of the ball. The results are clear: They are eighth in offense, third in defense, fifth in rebounding and turnover rate and, more importantly, have learned to play without Wembanyama. The improvement of Stephon Castle, Keldon Johnson’s shapeshifting ability and Dylan Harper’s development all have Johnson’s fingerprints on them as well. Haberstroh: Mitch Johnson. San Antonio hasn’t had the full complement of Victor Wembanyama, De’Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and Dylan Harper for half the season and yet it’s emerged as the second-best team in the loaded West. The first-year head coach has pulled all the right levers and scoffs at your NBA Cup hangover talk.The Midseason Defensive Player of the Year is ...Jensen: Victor Wembanyama. Dear NBA, the games played requirement for awards is officially nuts if Wemby goes his third straight season without winning DPOY, which in about 15 years should probably be named after him. The 7-foot-5 dynamo takes away everything. Shots at the rim, passing in the midrange area, corner 3-pointers, and everything in-between. His athleticism, length, and defensive IQ are all off the charts, and virtually all of his opponents rave about him after games. Come on now. Jones: Victor Wembanyama. His impact on the defensive end of the floor is a massive reason why the Spurs have been able to hang near the top of the Western Conference. A consistent presence in the paint, his weakside help consistently forces offenses to make decisions night in and night out. It’s not just his ability to erase space, rotate or protect the paint, it’s the communication and awareness to ensure he’s consistently in the right spot at the right time.  Haberstroh: Victor Wembanyama. I love that he and Chet Holmgren are going toe-to-toe — or fingertip-to-fingertip — for this award. The edge goes to Wemby for me because this is an individual award. The Thunder defense is elite no matter who steps on the floor. Wemby is the sole reason why the Spurs have a top-five defense in the NBA.Iko: Victor Wembanyama.There is no other player that alters opponents’ offensive game plans more aggressively than him. He’s the reason why the Spurs’ defense is menacing. Teams take the most shots from the perimeter and fewest at the rim when he’s on the floor (I wonder why that is), and don’t even think about getting easy baskets in transition. Devine: Victor Wembanyama. Just 45.4% of Spurs opponents’ shot attempts come in the paint when Wembanyama is on the floor; they convert those shots at league-worst levels when he’s out there. The Spurs allow a microscopic 105.8 points per 100 possessions in his floor time, and 117.4 points-per-100 without him; he is, in effect, the difference between San Antonio defending like the Thunder and defending like the Pacers. There are other reasonable answers — Rudy Gobert in Minnesota, Holmgren in OKC — but to me, the most obvious answer feels like the right one.The Midseason Sixth Man of the Year is ...Iko: Keldon Johnson, Spurs. He is the current favorite to win the award, according to BetMGM, but aside from that, let’s talk about the seventh-year guy who’s had to embody a different role nearly every season. He’s shooting a career-best from 3 (42%) and from 2 (63.3%); he’s among the upper echelon in rebounding rate; and he’s simplified his approach to basketball and seen it pay ultimate dividends for the Spurs. This just feels like a San Antonio year. Haberstroh: Jaime Jaquez Jr., Heat. The NBA leaders in points in the paint are a bunch of All-Stars with the exception of one bench player: Jaquez. The UCLA product has bounced back after a dreadful sophomore slump, nearly averaging 15-5-5 off the bench for a winning team in Miami.Devine: Isaiah Stewart, Pistons. You can just stuff your instant-offense guards and wings in a sack, Mister. Beef Stew is an all-around physical menace who leads the NBA in defensive field goal percentage allowed at the rim, who has turned himself into a credible frontcourt floor-spacer (36% from 3-point range) while also having the best interior finishing season of his career, and who has played a massive role in Detroit’s rise to second in the league in defensive efficiency and the top spot in the East. Stewart makes his impact differently than the kind of high-scoring ball-handlers who typically get this award, but that doesn’t mean the impact he makes is any less forceful, vital or worthy of recognition.Jensen: Keldon Johnson. This guy used to average 22 points per game, but has totally rebranded himself as a complete buy-in guy who does whatever is asked of him. He's rebounding better than ever, taking more shots from around the rim, and moving the ball with intent, all while coming off the bench and embracing his own role. It's a major success story for both him and the Spurs. Jones: Jaime Jaquez Jr. There are a variety of bench players who have really impacted their teams, so this could get even more interesting in the second half of the season. As of now, I salute Jaquez for how he’s helped lift Miami’s offensive attack. A shift to more spacing, more drive-and-kick and more cutting has been helped by Jaquez’s consistent ability to get into the paint and not only finish but showcase improved decision-making. The Midseason Most Improved Player is ...Iko: Deni Avdija, Trail Blazers. It’s hilarious to recall Avdija was the throw-in piece in the Malcolm Brogdon deal; this is a man averaging a stunning 30/7/7 since the calendar flipped to 2026. How do you argue against a fellow who’s been trusted with carrying Portland’s entire offense on his shoulders all while keeping the Blazers in the thick of the play-in? Look no further than the home-and-home against the Rockets for a microcosm of how important Avdija is to winning basketball. Sometimes all you need is a push. Or a trade away from the Wizards. Jones: Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Hawks. There is always a debate on what exactly this award should mean, and there are a lot of names that could be added to the list. There is a world where people point to Jalen Johnson, Jalen Duren and Dillon Brooks for their contributions. Keyonte George, Collin Gillespie and Anthony Black have consistently turned heads. I point to Alexander-Walker. Opportunity is everything, but to go from averaging single digits to 20 points a night is not easy. Haberstroh: Deni Avdija. The Blazers have missed more games due to injury than any team in the NBA, and yet they’re .500 in the West. It’s all because of Avdija, who’s now one of three players to average at least 25 points, six rebounds and six assists this season. It’s him, Luka Dončić and Nikola Jokić. His first All-Star is coming any day now. If he keeps this up — every value metric has him as a top-15 player this season — so should his first All-NBA appearance.Devine: Keyonte George, Jazz. This time last year, George was shooting under 40% from the floor with a too-high-for-a-lead-guard turnover rate while profiling as one of the NBA’s worst defenders. Now, he’s averaging 24 points, 7 assists and 4 rebounds per game, looking like a completely different, more composed and more aggressive offensive player. (He’s even showing — slightly — improved block and steal rates.) Reasonable arguments can be made for making-the-All-Star-leap dudes like Avdija and Duren; here, though, I’ll shout out someone who looked like he might be circling the drain on his way to being out of the league, but has done the work to climb back into consideration as a cornerstone for his franchise.Jensen: Nickeil Alexander-Walker.It's between Avdija, George, and Alexander-Walker for me. I lean toward Alexander-Walker because of that surprise factor. We saw Avdija wrap up 2024-25 on a high note, so this doesn't register as a major surprise. However, George is playing out of his mind, and if Utah had been just a slightly better team, I might have rewarded him for that. There's still time, though.",

Typically, the league's final playoff series of the season has begun on a Thursday and ended on a Sunday if a Game 7 was necessary. There is also the potential uniqueness of an NBA Finals game airing on a Saturday night (Game 5), something that has only happened once since 1981.2026 NBA Finals scheduleGame 1: Wednesday, June 3Game 2: Friday, June 5Game 3: Monday, June 8Game 4: Wednesday, June 10*Game 5: Saturday, June 13*Game 6: Tuesday, June 16*Game 7: Friday, June 19*if necessary(all games begin at 8:30 p.m. ET on ABC)There are two factors playing into how the NBA and ABC devised the schedule for this year. First, ABC is also airing the Stanley Cup Final, which will take place around the same time. Then you have the World Cup, which begins on June 11 and sees the United States begin its tournament on June 12 at 9 p.m. ET in Los Angeles. The second group game for the USMNT is a week later on Friday, June 19 at 3 p.m. ET in Seattle, hours before a potential Game 7.Since 2017 and 2018 when the Golden State Warriors went back-to-back, the NBA has seen seven different champions. Last season, the Oklahoma City Thunder topped the Indiana Pacers in first seven-game NBA Finals since 2016.As of Tuesday, the Thunder remain on top of the NBA with a 36-8 record. Behind them in the overall standings is the 31-10 Detroit Pistons and the 30-13 San Antonio Spurs.",

The Warriors acquired Butler in an effort to compete for another championship on the back end of Stephen Curry's prime. Butler's maintained his high level of play at 36 years old. In 37 games before Monday's, Butler was averaging 20.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.4 steals per game while shooting 51.9% from the field and 38.1% from 3. Curry, meanwhile, is averaging 27.6 points per game and leads the league for an 11th time with 4.5 made 3s per game on 38.6% shooting. He was named an All-Star starter earlier Monday.With Butler and Curry leading the team, the Warriors entered Monday's game at 24-19, good for eighth place the Western Conference.

The Mavericks remained in control of the game en route to a 114-97 win to improve to 18-26, good for 12th place in the West.The loss for the Knicks was their ninth in 11 games.

Due to their recent hot streak, the Clippers have climbed out of the dungeon in the West, but they are still barely hanging on to a play-in spot with a half-game lead over the Memphis Grizzlies in 10th place. The longer Leonard is absent, the more it’s likely to hurt their season an undo all the improvements over the past month.&nbsp;</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Two years ago today, the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/detroit/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">Detroit Pistons</a> were 4-37 and stumbling out of an NBA record 28-game losing streak. The Pistons were the league’s punchline, a team that would scrape together just 10 more wins before the nightmare finally ended. Now, they’re 30-10 and staring down at the rest of the Eastern Conference.</p><p>But the climb is only starting. The next few weeks before the Feb. 5 trade deadline will reveal what Detroit still needs to jump from a great story to an unquestionable favorite. Because when April turns into a possession-by-possession fight, everything starts with who can create offense against a set defense.</p><p>The hardest piece is already in place. The first thing a team needs to contend is a superstar, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/nba-all-star-2026-picking-the-eastern-conference-starters-205711016.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Cade Cunningham has officially leveled up</a> into a genuine All-NBA engine. He’s manipulating defenses with patience, ranking near the top of the league in assists while maintaining three-level scoring and versatile defense.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ED_011625_PistonsTradeDeadline.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ED_011625_PistonsTradeDeadline.jpg\" style=\"height:846px;width:1692px;\" alt=\"(Hayden Hodge/Yahoo Sports Illustration)\" data-uuid=\"c3541701-a588-4a5b-97e6-62bfc5fa55ec\"><figcaption>(Hayden Hodge/Yahoo Sports Illustration)</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>Stars aren’t enough in the modern NBA though. Recent champions and runners-up have been defined by depth. Between smart additions and developmental leaps, Detroit’s supporting cast is strong. Some of it is external. Duncan Robinson’s movement gravity has added a new wrinkle to the offense, while Caris LeVert has provided secondary creation off the bench. But like Cade’s leap, Detroit’s rise is really built on internal growth.</p><p>Jalen Duren belongs in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/first-time-nba-all-stars-whos-a-lock-whos-on-the-bubble-here-are-10-names-to-watch-204738521.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">East All-Star conversation</a> for his violent rim pressure, elite rebounding, and back-line defense. He used to drift in and out of games. Now he looks like the spine of an elite unit.</p><p>That shift has unlocked a second one. Last season, J.B. Bickerstaff barely played Duren next to another big. Duren and Isaiah Stewart shared the floor for only eight minutes. This season, about 25% of Duren’s minutes have come alongside Stewart. And it’s working because Stewart is also playing the best basketball of his life.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://youtube.com/@YahooNBA\" data-i13n=\"slk:Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube;cpos:4;pos:1\"><strong>Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>Stewart still has a reputation as the “tough guy,” and while that is true, he’s not just a classic interior bruiser. Over the last three seasons he’s a 37% 3-point shooter, which changes Detroit’s geometry when he can space to the line and punish any defender inside. But Stewart’s real gift is on defense.</p><p>Among 107 players who have defended at least 80 isolations this season, Stewart ranks best, allowing only 0.68 points per isolation. That’s one of the most dominant marks in recent years. The Pistons have comfortably let Stewart switch screens onto the likes of Donovan Mitchell and Kevin Durant, and he has the agility to stay connected without bleeding downhill drives.</p><p>If just one of Duren or Stewart is on the floor, the Pistons still have great rim protection thanks to their respective shot-blocking prowess. That lineup flexibility is a big reason the Pistons are second in NBA defensive rating, trailing only the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p><sports-player-card home-or-away=\"\" opposing-team=\"\" week=\"\" stat-list=\"\" player-id=\"nba.p.6703,nba.p.6408\" position=\"C\" stat-time-range=\"2025-2026\" stat-time-range-type=\"season\" stat-type=\"core\" season=\"2025-2026\" meta-data=\"\"/><p>Bench players like Alex Caruso and Aaron Wiggins had big scoring performances in OKC’s run last year, which serves as another example of why true contenders also need players who can light a spark.</p><p>For Detroit, you’d think it would be Jaden Ivey, Ron Holland, or Ausar Thompson, one of Detroit’s former lottery picks. And while each of them has carved out a role, the biggest jolt has often come from Daniss Jenkins, a 24-year-old guard on his second two-way contract after going undrafted in 2024. He’s already had a few “Jenkinsanity” bursts, recently erupting for a 20-point quarter and dishing out a career-high 15 assists. That fearless creation keeps Detroit’s offense from cratering when the starters catch a breather.</p><p>The Pistons certainly check a lot of boxes. And a great start makes fans happy, but it also creates a responsibility for the front office to figure out what breaks in the playoffs before the playoffs break it for you. When teams send two at Cade, is it because Thompson or Holland still can’t consistently make them pay as a spacer? If the ball is forced out of Cade’s hands, can Ivey or Tobias Harris be relied on to make a play? And does this roster have enough shooting to win playoff math? Detroit is 27th in 3-point attempts and 18th in 3-point percentage. That profile can survive in January. But maybe not in April.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/detroit\" data-i13n=\"slk:Get more Pistons news;cpos:5;pos:1\"><strong>Get more Pistons news: Detroit team feed</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>All of which brings us to the deadline. The Pistons have the ammo to address any holes. They control a full stash of future firsts, which means they can put four firsts plus three swaps on the table. They also have young players with value (Thompson, Ivey, Holland, Chaz Lanier, Marcus Sasser, and Bobi Klintman). And they have clean salary tools to make any deal work: Ivey is a $10.1 million upcoming restricted free agent, Harris is on a $26.6 million expiring contract, and LeVert will make just over $14 million for one additional season. Between them, other smaller salaries, and their assets, the Pistons can target just about any player.</p><p>Here are eight calls Detroit should make, ranked by impact and fit first, and availability second.</p><p><strong>1. Trey Murphy, Pelicans forward: </strong>Murphy is the cleanest fit for Detroit. He slides into the ecosystem without changing anyone’s shot diet, and his shooting and length raise both the floor and ceiling. At age 25, he also matches Cade’s timeline. The price would be steep (multiple firsts plus youth), but that’s what true two-way wings cost.</p><p><strong>2. Michael Porter Jr., Nets forward:</strong> MPJ is the more extreme version of the same idea. He is not the same defender as Murphy, but he is a more lethal shooter. Put a 6-foot-10 shotmaker next to Cade, Robinson, and Stewart, and defenses start running out of coverages. The Nets would expect a large return for MPJ.</p><div><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:200px;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/J0KhIu9Z\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen data-embed-domain=\"player.simplecast.com\" data-provider-name=\"iframe\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong>3. Jaren Jackson Jr., Grizzlies power forward:</strong> JJJ is the swing-for-the-fences option. He gives Detroit a third defensive superpower plus a big who can space and close playoff games. Memphis isn’t eager to move him, but given the uncertain state of the team, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/unlocking-a-contender-the-jaren-jackson-jr-trade-market-174324585.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">Detroit should make the call</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Naz Reid, Timberwolves big: </strong>The Wolves aren’t trying to trade Reid. But in theory, he’s the salary that’d have to move if Minnesota makes a big acquisition. And the Pistons previously expressed interest in signing him during his free agency just last summer, so maybe he could find his way to Detroit in some type of three-way deal. With his shot creation, shooting, and contagious energy, he’d be a perfect third big in Detroit’s frontcourt.</p><p><strong>5. Ayo Dosunmu, Bulls guard:</strong> Dosunmu has turned into a real shooter, he can slash into space, and he competes defensively. The Bulls are going nowhere and Dosunmu can be a free agent this summer, so perhaps they’d be willing to cash in.</p><p><strong>6. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Hawks wing: </strong>NAW is making 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s this season and he can do work off the dribble while also providing versatile defense. There&#39;s no reason for the Hawks to move him, especially since he&#39;s on such a team-friendly contract of four years, $60.6 million. But the Hawks seem stuck, and maybe they’d listen if the Pistons are willing to overpay.</p><p><strong>7. Klay Thompson, Mavericks wing:</strong> Klay is quietly having a bounce-back year in less-than-ideal circumstances in Dallas. He still bends defenses with instant-trigger shooting and elite relocation. At $16.7 million this season, he is also the kind of salary you can realistically absorb without detonating the rotation.</p><p><strong>8. Jerami Grant, Blazers wing:</strong> Welcome back! Grant was traded to the Blazers in 2022 following a career year with the Pistons, and he’s still a good player today. He’s a clean fit who can guard wings, hit spot-ups, and punish closeouts as a third option without stealing too many touches from Cade.&nbsp;</p><p><core-module type=\"curatedLinks\" title=\"More NBA news\" headerlink=\"\" subheadline=\"\" listid=\"eb86ae4b-e092-459b-a90f-9848764a50fb\"></core-module></p><p></p><p>Pistons fans who were around for the 2004 championship will remember the Rasheed Wallace acquisition. The Pistons were already a Finals hopeful at 34-22 and third in the East on the morning of the deadline. Chauncey Billups and Rip Hamilton were an exciting backcourt, Tayshaun Prince was having a breakout season on the wing, and Ben Wallace was in the middle of his second consecutive Defensive Player of the Year run. The Pistons were contenders. But the front office recognized that “good enough” wasn’t going to cut it.</p><p>So Detroit targeted Wallace just 10 days after he was already traded to Atlanta, and acquired him for a rotation player and multiple firsts. Wallace came with his warts with a league record technical foul history and a fiery personality that risked disrupting chemistry. And it did, but in a great way. The Pistons finished the year 20-6, as Sheed became a perfect on-court complement and the emotional spark plug that transformed Detroit into a championship unit.</p><p>Today’s Pistons find themselves in a nearly identical headspace. They have the engine in Cade, the defensive foundation in Duren and Stewart, and a newfound culture of winning under Bickerstaff. But how hard do you push? Detroit knows how quickly windows can open and shut. Two years ago, this was the league’s worst team. Now, the Pistons get to decide whether to act like a title team.</p>",

That <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/lebron-james-incredible-10-point-031155818.html\">came to an end in early December after 1,297 consecutive games</a> with 10 or more points.</p><p>In his prime, James carried teams to the NBA Finals through sheer will and overall skill. Although those days are behind him, LeBron could always count on his popularity during All-Star voting. No matter how much criticism James received on social media, All-Star voting consistently showed that, despite the chatter and hate, fans still loved King James.</p><p id=\"863b197140a243e3a370155354f8f667\"><core-module id=\"863b197140a243e3a370155354f8f667\" type=\"curatedLinks\" title=\"More NBA News\" headerLink=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/\" subheadline=\"Keep up with the 2025-26 NBA season with Yahoo Sports\" listid=\"eb86ae4b-e092-459b-a90f-9848764a50fb\"/></p><p>That long-standing trend, which lasted over two decades, has come to an end. Once regarded as one of the most durable players in league history, injuries have started to take a toll on James, causing him to miss more games. This season, James has appeared in 24 of the Lakers’ 41 games so far. At 41 years old, it seems that Father Time may have finally caught up to James and is pulling ahead in this race.</p><p>The Lakers are currently sitting in sixth place in the Western Conference (25-16) with a slim half-game lead over seventh-place Phoenix.</p>",

Porzingis has suited up for just 17 games for Atlanta this season after being acquired from the Boston Celtics during the offseason. When Porzingis has been on the court, he’s been productive this year, averaging 17.1 points and 5.1 rebounds while shooting 36% from 3-point range.</p><p>The Hawks are in 10th place in the Eastern Conference with a 20-25 record, clinging to the final play-in tournament slot.</p>",
