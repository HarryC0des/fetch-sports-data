The Clippers will conclude this three-game road trip with games against the Washington Wizards on Monday and the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday.</p><p>Knee irritation might not be a big deal for some players, but with Leonard’s history of knee and leg issues throughout his career, there is cause for concern anytime his knees are mentioned. Due to their recent hot streak, the Clippers have climbed out of the dungeon in the West, but they are still barely hanging on to a play-in spot with a half-game lead over the Memphis Grizzlies in 10th place. The longer Leonard is absent, the more it’s likely to hurt their season an undo all the improvements over the past month.&nbsp;</p>",
