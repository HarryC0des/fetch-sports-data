The longer Leonard is absent, the more it’s likely to hurt their season an undo all the improvements over the past month.&nbsp;</p>",

    "content_html": "<p>Two years ago today, the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/detroit/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">Detroit Pistons</a> were 4-37 and stumbling out of an NBA record 28-game losing streak. The Pistons were the league’s punchline, a team that would scrape together just 10 more wins before the nightmare finally ended. Now, they’re 30-10 and staring down at the rest of the Eastern Conference.</p><p>But the climb is only starting. The next few weeks before the Feb. 5 trade deadline will reveal what Detroit still needs to jump from a great story to an unquestionable favorite. Because when April turns into a possession-by-possession fight, everything starts with who can create offense against a set defense.</p><p>The hardest piece is already in place. The first thing a team needs to contend is a superstar, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/nba-all-star-2026-picking-the-eastern-conference-starters-205711016.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Cade Cunningham has officially leveled up</a> into a genuine All-NBA engine. He’s manipulating defenses with patience, ranking near the top of the league in assists while maintaining three-level scoring and versatile defense.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ED_011625_PistonsTradeDeadline.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ED_011625_PistonsTradeDeadline.jpg\" style=\"height:846px;width:1692px;\" alt=\"(Hayden Hodge/Yahoo Sports Illustration)\" data-uuid=\"c3541701-a588-4a5b-97e6-62bfc5fa55ec\"><figcaption>(Hayden Hodge/Yahoo Sports Illustration)</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>Stars aren’t enough in the modern NBA though. Recent champions and runners-up have been defined by depth. Between smart additions and developmental leaps, Detroit’s supporting cast is strong. Some of it is external. Duncan Robinson’s movement gravity has added a new wrinkle to the offense, while Caris LeVert has provided secondary creation off the bench. But like Cade’s leap, Detroit’s rise is really built on internal growth.</p><p>Jalen Duren belongs in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/first-time-nba-all-stars-whos-a-lock-whos-on-the-bubble-here-are-10-names-to-watch-204738521.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">East All-Star conversation</a> for his violent rim pressure, elite rebounding, and back-line defense. He used to drift in and out of games. Now he looks like the spine of an elite unit.</p><p>That shift has unlocked a second one. Last season, J.B. Bickerstaff barely played Duren next to another big. Duren and Isaiah Stewart shared the floor for only eight minutes. This season, about 25% of Duren’s minutes have come alongside Stewart. And it’s working because Stewart is also playing the best basketball of his life.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://youtube.com/@YahooNBA\" data-i13n=\"slk:Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube;cpos:4;pos:1\"><strong>Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>Stewart still has a reputation as the “tough guy,” and while that is true, he’s not just a classic interior bruiser. Over the last three seasons he’s a 37% 3-point shooter, which changes Detroit’s geometry when he can space to the line and punish any defender inside. But Stewart’s real gift is on defense.</p><p>Among 107 players who have defended at least 80 isolations this season, Stewart ranks best, allowing only 0.68 points per isolation. That’s one of the most dominant marks in recent years. The Pistons have comfortably let Stewart switch screens onto the likes of Donovan Mitchell and Kevin Durant, and he has the agility to stay connected without bleeding downhill drives.</p><p>If just one of Duren or Stewart is on the floor, the Pistons still have great rim protection thanks to their respective shot-blocking prowess. That lineup flexibility is a big reason the Pistons are second in NBA defensive rating, trailing only the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p><sports-player-card home-or-away=\"\" opposing-team=\"\" week=\"\" stat-list=\"\" player-id=\"nba.p.6703,nba.p.6408\" position=\"C\" stat-time-range=\"2025-2026\" stat-time-range-type=\"season\" stat-type=\"core\" season=\"2025-2026\" meta-data=\"\"/><p>Bench players like Alex Caruso and Aaron Wiggins had big scoring performances in OKC’s run last year, which serves as another example of why true contenders also need players who can light a spark.</p><p>For Detroit, you’d think it would be Jaden Ivey, Ron Holland, or Ausar Thompson, one of Detroit’s former lottery picks. And while each of them has carved out a role, the biggest jolt has often come from Daniss Jenkins, a 24-year-old guard on his second two-way contract after going undrafted in 2024. He’s already had a few “Jenkinsanity” bursts, recently erupting for a 20-point quarter and dishing out a career-high 15 assists. That fearless creation keeps Detroit’s offense from cratering when the starters catch a breather.</p><p>The Pistons certainly check a lot of boxes. And a great start makes fans happy, but it also creates a responsibility for the front office to figure out what breaks in the playoffs before the playoffs break it for you. When teams send two at Cade, is it because Thompson or Holland still can’t consistently make them pay as a spacer? If the ball is forced out of Cade’s hands, can Ivey or Tobias Harris be relied on to make a play? And does this roster have enough shooting to win playoff math? Detroit is 27th in 3-point attempts and 18th in 3-point percentage. That profile can survive in January. But maybe not in April.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/detroit\" data-i13n=\"slk:Get more Pistons news;cpos:5;pos:1\"><strong>Get more Pistons news: Detroit team feed</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>All of which brings us to the deadline. The Pistons have the ammo to address any holes. They control a full stash of future firsts, which means they can put four firsts plus three swaps on the table. They also have young players with value (Thompson, Ivey, Holland, Chaz Lanier, Marcus Sasser, and Bobi Klintman). And they have clean salary tools to make any deal work: Ivey is a $10.1 million upcoming restricted free agent, Harris is on a $26.6 million expiring contract, and LeVert will make just over $14 million for one additional season. Between them, other smaller salaries, and their assets, the Pistons can target just about any player.</p><p>Here are eight calls Detroit should make, ranked by impact and fit first, and availability second.</p><p><strong>1. Trey Murphy, Pelicans forward: </strong>Murphy is the cleanest fit for Detroit. He slides into the ecosystem without changing anyone’s shot diet, and his shooting and length raise both the floor and ceiling. At age 25, he also matches Cade’s timeline. The price would be steep (multiple firsts plus youth), but that’s what true two-way wings cost.</p><p><strong>2. Michael Porter Jr., Nets forward:</strong> MPJ is the more extreme version of the same idea. He is not the same defender as Murphy, but he is a more lethal shooter. Put a 6-foot-10 shotmaker next to Cade, Robinson, and Stewart, and defenses start running out of coverages. The Nets would expect a large return for MPJ.</p><div><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:200px;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/J0KhIu9Z\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen data-embed-domain=\"player.simplecast.com\" data-provider-name=\"iframe\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong>3. Jaren Jackson Jr., Grizzlies power forward:</strong> JJJ is the swing-for-the-fences option. He gives Detroit a third defensive superpower plus a big who can space and close playoff games. Memphis isn’t eager to move him, but given the uncertain state of the team, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/unlocking-a-contender-the-jaren-jackson-jr-trade-market-174324585.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">Detroit should make the call</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Naz Reid, Timberwolves big: </strong>The Wolves aren’t trying to trade Reid. But in theory, he’s the salary that’d have to move if Minnesota makes a big acquisition. And the Pistons previously expressed interest in signing him during his free agency just last summer, so maybe he could find his way to Detroit in some type of three-way deal. With his shot creation, shooting, and contagious energy, he’d be a perfect third big in Detroit’s frontcourt.</p><p><strong>5. Ayo Dosunmu, Bulls guard:</strong> Dosunmu has turned into a real shooter, he can slash into space, and he competes defensively. The Bulls are going nowhere and Dosunmu can be a free agent this summer, so perhaps they’d be willing to cash in.</p><p><strong>6. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Hawks wing: </strong>NAW is making 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s this season and he can do work off the dribble while also providing versatile defense. There&#39;s no reason for the Hawks to move him, especially since he&#39;s on such a team-friendly contract of four years, $60.6 million. But the Hawks seem stuck, and maybe they’d listen if the Pistons are willing to overpay.</p><p><strong>7. Klay Thompson, Mavericks wing:</strong> Klay is quietly having a bounce-back year in less-than-ideal circumstances in Dallas. He still bends defenses with instant-trigger shooting and elite relocation. At $16.7 million this season, he is also the kind of salary you can realistically absorb without detonating the rotation.</p><p><strong>8. Jerami Grant, Blazers wing:</strong> Welcome back! Grant was traded to the Blazers in 2022 following a career year with the Pistons, and he’s still a good player today. He’s a clean fit who can guard wings, hit spot-ups, and punish closeouts as a third option without stealing too many touches from Cade.&nbsp;</p><p><core-module type=\"curatedLinks\" title=\"More NBA news\" headerlink=\"\" subheadline=\"\" listid=\"eb86ae4b-e092-459b-a90f-9848764a50fb\"></core-module></p><p></p><p>Pistons fans who were around for the 2004 championship will remember the Rasheed Wallace acquisition. The Pistons were already a Finals hopeful at 34-22 and third in the East on the morning of the deadline. Chauncey Billups and Rip Hamilton were an exciting backcourt, Tayshaun Prince was having a breakout season on the wing, and Ben Wallace was in the middle of his second consecutive Defensive Player of the Year run. The Pistons were contenders. But the front office recognized that “good enough” wasn’t going to cut it.</p><p>So Detroit targeted Wallace just 10 days after he was already traded to Atlanta, and acquired him for a rotation player and multiple firsts. Wallace came with his warts with a league record technical foul history and a fiery personality that risked disrupting chemistry. And it did, but in a great way. The Pistons finished the year 20-6, as Sheed became a perfect on-court complement and the emotional spark plug that transformed Detroit into a championship unit.</p><p>Today’s Pistons find themselves in a nearly identical headspace. They have the engine in Cade, the defensive foundation in Duren and Stewart, and a newfound culture of winning under Bickerstaff. But how hard do you push? Detroit knows how quickly windows can open and shut. Two years ago, this was the league’s worst team. Now, the Pistons get to decide whether to act like a title team.</p>",

Each conference will have seven reserves.</p><p>Previously, those seven reserves were made up of two backcourt players and three frontcourt players, plus two wild cards. Now they, too, will be picked without regard to position.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-all-star-games-new-format\">What you need to know about the All-Star Game&#39;s new format</h2><p>This year&#39;s All-Star Game will feature three teams: <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/breaking-news/article/nba-switching-all-star-game-format-again-will-have-usa-vs-world-round-robin-tournament-in-2026-024710036.html\">Two will consist of players from the United States, and a third will be made up of players from the rest of the world</a>.</p><p>The process for assigning players to the two U.S. teams will be determined at a later date, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nba.com/news/nba-all-star-faq-2026\">according to the league</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, of the 24 total All-Star roster spots, voting will fill 16 of them with U.S. players and eight of them with international players, who, if necessary, can be American players with ties to other countries.</p><p>But if those numbers aren&#39;t reached organically, NBA commissioner Adam Silver will pick additional All-Stars so that each group hits its mark. In that scenario, at least one team would end up with more than eight players.</p><p id=\"0713322509a643658268b4173f3a850a\"><core-module id=\"0713322509a643658268b4173f3a850a\" type=\"curatedLinks\" title=\"More NBA news\" headerLink=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/\" subheadline=\"From the experts at Yahoo Sports\" listid=\"eb86ae4b-e092-459b-a90f-9848764a50fb\"/></p><p>For instance, if there&#39;s a 15-9 split among U.S. and international All-Stars, one extra U.S. player would get the commissioner&#39;s nod, meaning that there&#39;d be 25 total All-Stars and the international team would have nine players instead of eight.</p><p>In terms of the game itself, there will still technically be four 12-minute quarters, although each will be its own game, as each of the three teams will play twice during round-robin action. The fourth &quot;quarter&quot; will pit the two teams with the best records — point differential will be the post-round-robin tiebreaker if all three teams have 1-1 records — to decide a champion.</p>",

The Hawks then had a chance at a game-winning or game-tying shot with the ball and a 112-110 deficit in the final 12 seconds.

This <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/videos/atlanta-hawks-vs-milwaukee-bucks-204716777.html\">was Atlanta’s fourth loss in a row</a>.

He played in 72 games during his rookie campaign of 2015-16 with the New York Knicks and was named to the NBA All-Rookie team. Since that first year, Porzingis hasn’t played in more than 66 games in a season. Porzingis did that in his second season and wouldn’t come close again until the 2022-23 season in Washington.</p><p>Second-year player Risacher missed his sixth straight game on Monday because of a bone contusion in his left knee. Risacher was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft and finished second in Rookie of the Year voting last year. This season, he’s appeared in 36 games, averaging 11.2 points and 3.3 rebounds per game.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"3b7993e8bed645339c5d9c634e138d42\"><core-module id=\"3b7993e8bed645339c5d9c634e138d42\" type=\"curatedLinks\" title=\"More NBA News\" headerlink=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/\" subheadline=\"\" listid=\"eb86ae4b-e092-459b-a90f-9848764a50fb\"/></p><p>Both players will be re-evaluated sometime next week. Porzingis has suited up for just 17 games for Atlanta this season after being acquired from the Boston Celtics during the offseason. When Porzingis has been on the court, he’s been productive this year, averaging 17.1 points and 5.1 rebounds while shooting 36% from 3-point range.</p><p>The Hawks are in 10th place in the Eastern Conference with a 20-25 record, clinging to the final play-in tournament slot.</p>",
