    "description": "Ultimately, if the Knicks want to contend, their defense is going to have to hit a certain level.",
    "content_html": "The New York Knicks are the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference, which wouldn’t feel all that disappointing had we not just seen the Knicks winning the NBA Cup and knocking on the door of the Detroit Pistons a month ago. The question now is, which version of the Knicks is real? Coach Mike Brown was brought in to deliver a stronger process to a preexisting identity. A lot of the early talk surrounded the Knicks’ offense. More tempo, more pace, and more empowerment throughout the roster would elevate New York on an end of the floor that tended to get stagnant. That came with an understanding that the defense may not remain at the level it was under Tom Thibodeau, but there was enough of a base to sustain success on that end. A little slippage defensively with a competitive mindset mixed with better offensive flow would be the package to elevate the Knicks. [Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]According to NBA.com, the Knicks are No. 3 in offensive rating (119.1) and No. 17 in defensive rating (115). But here’s the key: In November, the Knicks were No. 2 in offensive rating (122.8) and No. 10 in defensive rating (112.3); in December, the Knicks were No. 2 in offensive rating (123.2) and No. 21 in defensive rating (118); and during their recent 2-9 stretch, opponents averaged 117.4 points per game (25th in the league during that time). Is this a team that can’t defend, or a team that can’t afford to not defend? New York’s defensive state of mindWhen the Knicks are humming on defense, it’s the effort that jumps off the screen. Is this a perfect defensive unit? Absolutely not. But when they have the mindset to work on that end of the floor, they can usually live with the results. Active ball pressure. Physicality off-ball. Scrambling and recovering. Switches anticipating the next step in the defensive process. A unit defending on a string, working to find a way to get a stop and get out in transition. If the Knicks’ defense is able to give that type of effort, then what is the issue? Consistency and connection.In the two clips below, a simple backscreen exposes what happens to the Knicks’ defense when they are not connected. Devin Booker sets a backscreen for Jordan Goodwin, which puts Jalen Brunson in action, but that’s not the only issue. While Mikal Bridges is working to get to Booker’s body, Mitchell Robinson is outside of the paint, no switch takes place and it’s an easy layup. Against Brooklyn, the Knicks are able to navigate a dribble handoff, but a backscreen does them in again. Michael Porter Jr. screens, Josh Hart sees it and takes the cut. Unfortunately, OG Anunoby is working to fight over and that separation opens a look for MPJ for 3. The Knicks’ activity on defense requires connection or it can work against them. When the Knicks’ defense is working well, you can see them working to get bodies on cutters and working to navigate screens. A key is the timing of their rotations; the earlier they show help, the better chance they have to recover and reset. Notice in the first clip when Porter gets a handoff and Robinson engages, Anunoby is already in the paint to take away the roll. Deuce McBride and Anunoby both work to close out and the Knicks do well. Against Phoenix, when a pindown for Booker turns into pick-and-roll, you see no bodies in the paint from the Knicks. There’s a free lane to finish and a reminder of what happens when the Knicks are not tied together. As important as it is for a defense to be early and show help, the rotations behind that are just as key. The idea is to help the helper, and work to ensure the defense can help and recover. There is a reason why the top defensive teams consistently give multiple efforts. Can the Knicks depend on Karl-Anthony Towns?Part of the reason it’s so important for the Knicks to have a strong base defensively is because of the inevitable fact that teams are going to put Karl-Anthony Towns and Brunson in action. I’m a believer in Towns on the defensive end from a coaching perspective because, at the end of the day, you just have to land in the “do your job” territory. With the right defensive personnel around him, if he executes his portion, the Knicks can likely survive. The question that has popped up this season is which scheme works for him that the Knicks can depend on?In general, the Knicks have been able to live with Towns working toward the level of the screen, being active and trusting the rotations behind it. But his activity in this coverage has regressed this season, which puts even more pressure on the rotations behind the defense to cover things up. So if that scheme is no longer at the top of the playbook, where do you pivot?The optimal setting for Towns in New York has been for him to be in drop coverage in pick-and-roll. As the season has progressed, the Knicks have worked to keep side pick-and-rolls on that same side (a little ironic considering Thibs was just there), but the challenge remains the same. In an ideal setting, defenders are able to navigate the screen and recover while Towns can remain in the paint and contain the roller. The issue becomes the positioning if they can’t get back in front and aren’t ready to protect the rim. What’s intriguing in the last clip is that even when the Knicks went double-big, Towns was still in a drop. There is an ability to give those multiple efforts, contain and recover, but it has to be a constant for the Knicks. The other key is how many other schemes can be trusted? The Knicks have continued to mix in late switches with KAT when he is dropped back. If the primary defender gets hit with a screen, Towns will take the ball-handler and the Knicks’ defense resets. Containing those drives becomes key in those moments, but the more flexibility the Knicks have the better. Late switches are one thing, but how much do you want Towns to outright switch? It’s not an automatic for the Knicks, but it’s something to keep an eye on as we get closer to the playoffs. It’s more likely to be seen when he is in a double-big lineup with Robinson. The key is for KAT to switch, contain the drive and then be ready to defend on the weakside. Show help, close out, recover back. When Towns gives multiple efforts, you can live with the results. What about Jalen Brunson?It’s important to have your base set and your Towns coverages set because you also have to be prepared for teams to attack Brunson.Teams are going to put Brunson in action by a) forcing him to navigate screens and b) using whoever he is defending as a screener to try to force a mismatch. Against Phoenix in the clip below, he works to fight over a screen and is immediately put in action. He does a good job of showing early and recovering, McBride helps him on the roll, and he returns the favor by being in position to take a charge on a drive. The problem comes when some of the Knicks’ defensive issues bleed into the things offenses want to attack. In the clips below you can see how a small breakdown can create an issue for the Knicks. Against Phoenix, Brunson is calling for the switch against Booker. McBride fights over the top which opens a pop for a 3. Against Dallas, Brunson is going show-and-recover, only Hart goes with the roll, which opens a lane for Naji Marshall to drive. Every defense has something an offense wants to attack; the thing is you have to be clean and consistent in how you handle it. A good sign for the Knicks is they have been self-aware, understanding they have to have the right mindset on the defensive end if they want to hit their goals. Ultimately, if they want to contend, the defense is going to have to hit a certain level. There is a chance that having a playoff game plan and focusing on one team helps them, but they have to build their base and versatility on their way there.",

    "link": "https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/cooper-flaggs-impressive-rookie-season-has-put-him-in-elite-company--and-given-mavs-fans-hope-again-200436896.html",
    "description": "One of the most highly touted prospects in a generation is growing up a lot faster than it would’ve seemed reasonable to expect.",
    "content_html": "The first time the Dallas Mavericks played the Miami Heat this season, Cooper Flagg started out slowly: just six points through three quarters, making only three of the nine shots he took, with three turnovers in 24 minutes. And then, with the Mavs down by seven and about nine and a half minutes to go in the fourth quarter, the 2025 NBA Draft’s No. 1 overall pick checked back in … and, suddenly, he was damn near everywhere.Dallas’ comeback effort came up short, but the then-18-year-old’s closing kick — six points, four boards, two assists, a steal and relentless activity in those final nine-and-a-half minutes — made an impression.“He's not scared of the moment,\" star Heat center Bam Adebayo told Tim Reynolds of The Associated Press. “A lot of guys would move to the corner when there’s two minutes left in a close ball game ... he was going to get the ball. He's growing up faster than people think.”Including, maybe, the Heat. When the two teams played again a week and a half later, Flagg scored a team-high 22 on 9-for-13 shooting in a 10-point Mavericks win.This, as much as anything, has been the story of Flagg’s rookie season, which passed the halfway mark this week as he played key roles in wins over the slumping Knicks and injury-rocked Warriors. The campaign continues Saturday with what ought to be a pretty interesting nationally televised home game against the Los Angeles Lakers — nearly one year removed from the gobsmacking dead-of-night deal that shipped Luka Dončić to L.A.Trading Luka for Anthony Davis removed the cornerstone on which the Mavericks franchise was built, precipitating Dallas’ downfall as a putative championship contender and beginning Nico Harrison’s slow march to the exit at the American Airlines Center. It also created a need for a new cornerstone — one better positioned for the task than Davis or Kyrie Irving, both on the wrong side of 30 and often (andcurrently) on the wrong side of the injury report.That vacuum has been filled, thanks to a staggering amount of draft-lottery luck, by Flagg: one of the most highly touted prospects in a generation, one of the most productive teenagers the NBA has ever seen, and a preternatural talent that, as Adebayo put it, is growing up a hell of a lot faster than it would’ve seemed reasonable to expect.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Flagg’s arrival can only do so much to abate and ameliorate the pain and trauma of the Dončić deal for a number of reasons, not least of which is the basic point that it’s really hard to replace an All-Star starter without downgrading. But even as the Mavs scuffle below .500 and near the bottom of the NBA in offensive efficiency, the presence of Flagg — rising up to the top of the rookie class, jousting with former Duke teammate Kon Knueppel and 76ers ace VJ Edgecombe in consideration for Rookie of the Year honors at the season’s midway point — gives Dallas fans something to grab hold of, a reason to believe that better days are ahead, sooner rather than later.Flagg enters Saturday’s tilt against the Lakers averaging 18.8 points, 6.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game, with a true shooting percentage (which factors in 2-point, 3-point and free-throw accuracy) of .554. Here is the list of rookies to average 18-6-4 on .550 TS% in NBA history:Oscar RobertsonKareem Abdul-JabbarMagic JohnsonMichael JordanI am not saying that Flagg is guaranteed to be one of the 10 best players in NBA history. I am just saying that what he has done so far puts him on a pretty cool friggin’ list. (And, for whatever it’s worth: None of those guys was doing that as a teenager.)The only rookies this century to score as much, as efficiently and with as high a usage rate as Flagg has this season were Karl-Anthony Towns a decade ago and Victor Wembanyama two years back. The last two to do it before them: Tim Duncan and Shaquille O’Neal.Landing among such all-time elite offensive company would be impressive enough. Reaching that level on a team nearly denuded of high-level complementary offensive talent capable of deflecting defensive attention away from you is downright exceptional. (Not you, Naji Marshall. I think you’re high-level complementary offensive talent, and I always have.)With Davis once again sidelined, still no timeline for Irving’s return, third-year center Dereck Lively II lost for the season and plenty of other contributors missing time, leaving the Mavericks as one of the most injury-ravaged teams in the NBA, Flagg — the youngest player in the NBA — has gotten a crash course in doing damn near everything there is to do on the basketball court. His introduction to the pro game saw him suddenly tasked with masquerading as a point guard; that, um, didn’t go so hot. Being thrown into the fire, though, gave the über-prospect an up-close-and-personal brush with failure the likes of which he never experienced — an encounter that Flagg says has paid dividends as he works his way through his maiden voyage through the senior circuit.“I don't know if I was ready for that or if I was ready to handle that right off the bat,\" he told ESPN’s Tim MacMahon. \"I tried my best, and I mean, that's not to say I can't go back to it and can't work on it and get better, but I think it's just worked out where it's been better to have somebody else helping out, relieving pressure. ... It wasn't perfect, but I think I learned a lot through that.\"Playing more frequently with fellow rookie Ryan Nembhard or reserve ball-handler Brandon Williams, Flagg has blossomed on the other side of the experiment, averaging more than 20 points and nearly 4.5 assists per game over the last 30 games while making 55% of his 2-point shots. The list of players doing that over the course of the full season looks like an All-NBA ballot.And while shifting from the point back to the wing reduces his responsibility for bringing the ball up the floor and initiating offensive sets, it hasn’t exactly meant the kid’s suddenly getting spoon-fed. Flagg’s still shouldering a massive burden when it comes to generating his own scoring chances; according to NBA Advanced Stats, 56% of his baskets this season have been unassisted. Only 30 players in the NBA (minimum 20 games played and 20 minutes per game) are creating for themselves that often — a list that, when you filter for high-minute players like Flagg, is almost exclusively populated by All-Star-level lead guards and No. 1 offensive options. Flagg generates those looks for himself the hard way: by doing the engine-room work of lowering his head and his shoulder and bulldozing his way to the basket.As The Ringer’s Kirk Goldsberry recently noted, Flagg leads all rookies in drives to the rim. In fact, he’s tied for 35th in the entire league, averaging as many forays to the cup per game as Edwards, and 19th in points scored per game off those drives, right behind Pascal Siakam and Donovan Mitchell. My colleague Steve Jones Jr. recently highlighted the right-handed Flagg’s adeptness at driving to his left, and the numbers bear that out: Flagg opts for his non-dominant hand on nearly 63% of his drives, according to Synergy Sports, producing more than one point per possession and shooting 51.1% on those left-hand attacks.While Flagg’s ability to steamroll downhill to create for himself is impressive enough, one area of growth as he moves through the early stages of his career is getting more comfortable facilitating while handling the ball in the two-man game. Including possessions where he passes to a teammate who shoots, Flagg’s pick-and-rolls are producing 0.951 points per possession, according to Synergy. That’s not a particularly exceptional number in and of itself — about league average overall, and 68th out of 93 players finishing at least five plays per game out of the pick-and-roll.[Get more Mavericks news: Dallas team feed]On the other hand, though — and it’s really worth hammering this point home — “about league average at generating points out of the pick-and-roll” is pretty damn good for a just-turned-19-year-old stepping immediately into a primary shot creation role that he’d never played before. And it’s also worth noting that, as with so much else about his game, Flagg seems to be getting better at it as the season goes along.Over the past month, Dallas has scored 1.063 points per possession out of Flagg’s pick-and-rolls — a mark that would rank between what Mitchell and Jaylen Brown are generating out of the two-man game this season. The reads and passes are rarely breathtaking, but the court vision that he flashed in his fits-and-starts point guard days continues to produce good looks — either for himself after keeping a defender in jail and probing the paint, or for a teammate after the help leans too far in his direction — for an offense that desperately needs them:Due in part to the relative lack of offensive threats around him, especially with Davis back on the shelf and Irving still in street clothes, teams have been sending more defensive attention at Flagg — loading the coverage toward him, trapping him as he comes off a ball screen, trying to heat him up and force the ball out of his hands. Learning how to patiently play through that kind of pressure takes time and repetition, with today’s pain bringing the promise of more efficient production tomorrow.“He’s going each and every night,” Davis said last month, according to Christian Clark of The Athletic. “Each possession. They are trying to put their toughest defender on him every night. Try to take away his ability to put the ball on the floor and score. But he’s handling it very well. Making plays out of the double teams. It’s our job to capitalize when he makes the right play.”The Mavs haven’t done that often enough this season, shooting just 39.7% off his passes, including a dismal 30.6% on 3-point looks, according to NBA Advanced Stats — in keeping with the sour overall flavor of an attack that ranks 25th or worse in 3-point attempts, makes and percentage, 28th in points per half-court possession, and 27th in overall offensive efficiency. It’s easy to imagine future Dallas rosters built around Flagg prioritizing perimeter shooting, looking to leverage the way that his size and skill enables him to penetrate into the teeth of the defense by flanking him with marksmen capable of cashing out after he drives, reads and kicks.\"The biggest thing that stands out to me is his athleticism,\" a Western Conference scout recently told MacMahon of ESPN. \"If I'm the GM here, I'm adding as much shooting as possible and building around him for a long time.\"Flank Flagg with floor-spacers and give him the green light to get downhill, and it seems like you’ve got the recipe for a damn good offense. The only fly in the ointment is Flagg’s own jumper: just 33.5% outside the paint and 28.3% from 3-point land, including a surprising 24.2% on supposedly easier catch-and-shoot triple tries. If he can’t iron out the wrinkles in his J, defenses will be able to duck under ball screens, sag off him and crowd the paint, clogging up driving lanes and making it more difficult for him to create for himself and others.For what it’s worth, though, at least one pretty reliable source when it comes to shooting the ball isn’t too worried about the kid’s overall outlook …Dirk Nowitzki on Cooper Flagg: “My rookie season, I shot 29% from three and it ended up being okay. We’re not worried about Cooper’s three ball.” pic.twitter.com/1rVoLlQx73— NBA on Prime (@NBAonPrime) January 23, 2026… which seems smart, considering Flagg’s up to 36% from deep on nearly four attempts per game over the past month — yet another area in which he just continues to improve, night after night, game after game.Just like his rebounding. Kidd recently challenged Flagg to be more active and aggressive on the glass.“That’s one area we believe he can get better at,” Kidd said, according to Mike Curtis of the Dallas Morning News. “With time, he’ll figure that out.”Flagg pulled down a season-high 11 boards in Thursday’s win over the Warriors. You don’t need that much time when you’re growing up faster than people think.",

    "description": "Nico Harrison cited Dončić&#39;s defense as a reason for trading him a year ago. Is L.A. running into a similar problem?",
    "content_html": "Each week during the 2025-26 NBA season, we will take a deeper dive into some of the league’s biggest storylines in an attempt to determine whether trends are based more in fact or fiction moving forward.Last week: Jonathan Kuminga is a good basketball playerFact or Fiction: The Lakers can build a champion around Luka Dončić’s defenseEvery time you type “JJ Redick” into a search engine, you’re hit with some headline like, Lakers coach blasts team’s effort, or, The latest attempt to solve Los Angeles’ defense!“Look, my staff and I, our analytics team, this is all we’re doing right now,” Redick told reporters following Tuesday’s 115-107 win over the shorthanded Denver Nuggets. “We’re trying to figure out what’s the best way for this team, with this group, to play defense.”We are at the season’s midwaypoint. (In fact, we are nearing the one-year anniversary of Luka Dončić’s trade to the Los Angeles Lakers, who face his former team on Saturday!)This is an improvement from December, when Redick seemed to think there was no tactical adjustment to cure what ailed his defense, other than more effort from his players.“We practice this stuff enough,” he said after a loss to the Phoenix Suns. “We review this stuff enough. We show film on this stuff enough that to me it comes down to … just making the choice. It’s making the choice. There are shortcuts you can take, or you can do the hard thing, and you can make the second effort, or you can sprint back, or you can't.”Whether it is the coaching staff’s scheme or their players’ intention, the fact of the matter is: The Lakers’ defense is bad. On the season, they rate 25th out of 30 teams, allowing 117.3 points per 100 possessions. Since the start of December, when the Lakers are 11-13, they have allowed 119.2 points per 100 possessions, rating 29th on the defensive end. Only the Utah Jazz, who own the worst defensive rating in NBA history, have been worse than L.A.One reason they are terrible at defense: Nobody gets hunted more than Dončić. (Hassan Ahmad/Yahoo Sports Illustration)According to Synergy’s play-type statistics, teams complete 2.2 possessions per game opposite Dončić’s isolation defense, the most of anyone in the league. Granted, this only accounts for how many plays opponents finish against Dončić, not necessarily how many times he gets hunted throughout a game, but it gives us a good portrait of the problem.(Tyler Herro ranks second behind Dončić in that regard, to give you an idea of its accuracy.)Of course, another reason they are terrible at defense: They failed to surround Dončić with anyone capable of stopping the ball. Dončić’s co-stars, LeBron James and Austin Reaves, are far from defensive stoppers. And Deandre Ayton is hardly a rim protector.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]As Redick said following a recent blowout loss, “I thought our low man was awful all night.”Marcus Smart might be the Lakers’ best option at the point of attack, but the 31-year-old is four years and several injuries removed from being the NBA’s Defensive Player of the Year.“There's really no defense, no scheme we can do when we're giving up offensive rebounds in crucial moments like we are, or guys are getting wherever they want on the court,” Smart conceded in December. \"And there's no help, there's no resistance, there's no urgency. So, it's tough. And JJ is right: There's really nothing he can do. It's on us.\"And us isn’t good enough, defensively, to win a championship.Which begs the same question Dallas Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison answered in the negative at this time last year: Can you build a champion around Dončić’s defense?The short answer: Of course. (Spoiler alert: Nico was not right.)A 24-year-old Dončić led the Mavericks to the 2024 NBA Finals with Kyrie Irving as his co-star. Daniel Gafford, Derrick Jones Jr. and P.J. Washington were the other three starters. That roster rated 18th on the defensive end during the regular season, hardly a juggernaut, and they came within three wins of a championship. Build the right team around Dončić — a roster full of two-way contributors — and obviously you can win a championship with him.He is, after all, one in the handful of best basketball players in the world, averaging a league-leading  33.4 points per game, to go along with 8.7 assists and 7.8 rebounds a night.All of which now leads us to the question at hand: Can the Lakers build a champion around Dončić? That is a far more complicated question to answer, and not just because their front office has made a series of missteps since winning the 2020 title. Then again, they did win that championship, they did acquire Dončić, and they did develop Reaves.(Ownership also may have been messy, but that is a story for a different day.)The presence of James and Reaves, along with Dončić, is a defensive problem. They are three of the most talented scorers in the game, and the team’s three best players, and the Lakers want them all on the floor together, only they are being outscored by 7.4 points per 100 possessions, almost as bad as this year’s Washington Wizards, when that is the case.Even if James, the 41-year-old phenom, who has lost several steps defensively, has a frosty relationship with Lakers leadership — a report he did not flatly deny on Thursday — it would be awfully difficult for them to piece together a trade by the Feb. 5 trade deadline, especially one that returns them enough help defensively to patch together a contender.[Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed]He is, however, a free agent at season’s end, and it is becoming increasingly less surprising that James and the Lakers may mutually part ways this summer. In fact, the franchise can clear as much as $54 million in salary cap space in July, according to Spotrac’s Keith Smith.That gives the Lakers one chance — this summer — to spend on the roster around Dončić, before Reaves (assuming he opts out of his $15 million contract for next season) signs what could be something close to a maximum extension of his own. Then our question becomes: Can the Lakers build a champion around the defense of Dončić and Reaves?Right now, the Lakers, when Dončić and Reaves are on the court without James, are outscoring opponents by 14.2 points per 100 meaningful possessions, according to Cleaning the Glass, operating at a historic level offensively and a top-3 level defensively.That is beyond encouraging. The idea, then: Use the Mavericks’ blueprint, only with Reaves in the Irving role as Dončić’s co-star, and find three two-way forces to play along with them.Problem is: The 2026 free-agency class is a dud, at least in terms of defensive stalwarts. Might a 36-year-old Draymond Green decline his $27.7 million option for next season if more money awaited in L.A.? Does the oft-injured Robert Williams III interest the Lakers?More likely, the Lakers will have to get creative, trying to trade players into their cap space, using their far-out future draft picks as bait, and possibly even dangling Reaves if a return is right. Can they get someone like Trey Murphy III or Herb Jones, or both, from the New Orleans Pelicans? Every other team in the league is in search of the same 3-and-D wings.Our final question, then — another to come back to on another day — if we think we have sufficiently answered the one at hand (and of course the Lakers can build a champion around Dončić; any team can): Is Rob Pelinka the executive the Lakers want doing the job?The Lakers are under new ownership, a group that did not hire Pelinka, and they will be both motivated to win and to spend, especially after investing $10 billion in the team.Determination: Fact. The Lakers can build a champion around Dončić. Just not this season. It will take time — perhaps years’ worth — but the good news is they have it. Dončić is 26 years old and under contract through the 2028-29 season. (Thanksagain, Nico.)",

    "description": "James commented for the first time since an ESPN report featured Buss souring on James&#39; power within the franchise and took a dim view of the superstar&#39;s perceived ingratitude for drafting his son.",
    "content_html": "It's been a week for the Los Angeles Lakers. On the court there was a comeback victory against the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, followed by a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night in which head coach J.J. Redick said his team didn't trust each other on the court. In between was a lengthy ESPN exposé on the contentious family drama involving Lakers governor and minority owner Jeanie Buss and her siblings. The report also featured Buss souring on James' power within the franchise, and took a dim view of the superstar's perceived ingratitude for drafting his son, Bronny. Buss refuted that particular claim in a statement to The Athletic. So you can imagine what set of questions James faced from reporters after Thursday's 112-104 defeat at the Clippers. When asked what he thought about his partnership with Buss, James said, \"I thought it was good. But, you know, somebody could see it another way. There's always two sides to a coin.\"LeBron James on his relationship with Jeanie pic.twitter.com/nrf91revHZ— Melissa Rohlin (@melissarohlin) January 23, 2026Before that, James told the group of reporters in the locker room that the story didn't impact him. \"Quite frankly I don't really care about articles. I really don't,\" James said. \"I don't care about stories, I don't care about podcasts and all that type of s***. That don't bother me. … I don’t care how somebody feels about me. If you know me personally, then you know what I’m about.\" [Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Earlier this month, James' agent and longtime friend Rich Paul created a stir from his podcast when he said the Lakers should deal Austin Reaves before the trade deadline. James distanced himself from those comments last week. As for his relationship with Buss, James gave a quizzical look when he was asked if the two had cleared the air after ESPN's report.  \"We never talk. I don't understand,” James said. “It's not like me and Jeanie been on the phone talking. You guys ain’t never heard a report about that. Don't make something out of it that's not. It's always been mutual, it's always been respect, it's always been a great partnership.\"",

    "content_html": "Kawhi Leonard returned to the Los Angeles Clippers' lineup after missing the past three games with a left knee contusion. He made a significant impact, scoring 24 points in a 112-104 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at the Intuit Center on Thursday night. Leonard came into Thursday's game averaging a career-high 28.9 points while playing in 30 of the Clippers' 43 games. He had scored a combined 68 points versus the Washington Wizards and Charlotte Hornets in the two games he played before sitting out with his injury. Leonard played 25 minutes, shooting 9-for-19 (and 3-of-7 on 3-pointers) from the floor. Kawhi doing Kawhi things 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/WRH7eWx4JW— LA Clippers (@LAClippers) January 23, 2026The Clippers held a 79-53 lead midway through the third quarter after an Ivica Zubac dunk. From there, however, the Lakers chipped away at that 26-point margin with a 19-7 run to end the frame. That became a 34-14 run that trimmed the Clippers' lead to 93-85 by the 7:40 mark of the fourth quarter. A Luka Dončić fadeaway 3-pointer with Kris Dunn guarding him moved the Lakers to within 93-91 with 5:56 remaining. But James Harden countered with a 3 of his own to finally stop the Lakers' momentum and steady the Clippers. John Collins followed with a layup and Zubac hit two free throws to restore the Clippers' lead back to 100-91 with under four minutes to play. LUKA DONCIC. OUT OF THIS WORLD. pic.twitter.com/mn8yi1zSqY— Italo Santana (@BulletClubIta) January 23, 2026Clippers coach Ty Lue then won a big replay challenge, arguing that a foul on Jordan Miller should instead be ruled a loose ball foul on the Lakers' Marcus Smart. Lue won the challenge, which took two free throws away from Smart and awarded them to Miller because the Lakers were in the penalty. Miller made one of the two free throws, but that gave the Clippers a 10-point lead. Yet the Lakers fought back again with LeBron James getting a fast-break dunk and Smart turning a Miller turnover into a jumper. Leonard committed another turnover, losing the ball out of bounds, and that led to a Jarred Vanderbilt dunk to cut the Clippers' lead to 103-99. Following two free throws by Zubac, James was fouled on a layup and made the subsequent free throw for a 3-point play to pull the Lakers to within 105-102. But Zubac followed with a reverse dunk and Collins hit a 3-pointer after Rui Hachimura missed a long-range shot of his own. That was the dagger, giving the Clippers a 110-102 lead with 43 seconds remaining. Doncic finished with a game-high 32 points, but shot 11-of-27 from the floor (including 3-of-13 on 3s). He added 11 rebounds and 8 assists. James scored 23 points after tallying only 9 at halftime. But he also shot 9-of-19 while grabbing 5 rebounds and dishing out 6 assists. The Lakers' loss dropped them to 26-17 and the No. 6 spot in the Western Conference, behind the Houston Rockets and Phoenix Suns. Up next, they visit the Dallas Mavericks (19-26) for a nationally televised prime-time matchup Saturday on ABC. The Mavs have won four in a row and five of their past six games.For the Clippers, Zubac scored 18 points with 19 rebounds while Harden also scored 18 and notched 10 assists. Altogether, seven Clippers reached double figures in scoring. The win was the Clippers' 14th in their past 17 games and improved their record to 20-24, good for 10th place in the West. They're off until Sunday, when they host the Brooklyn Nets (12-30).",

Yet the Rockets rallied to tie the score at 88-88 on a Dorian Finney-Smith 3-pointer with 21 seconds left in the third. Kevin Durant also hit three 3s to boost the Houston comeback. Two missed calls by the officials resulted in the game going to overtime. At the end of regulation, Durant appeared to commit goaltending on blocking Maxey's layup attempt with three seconds remaining. He blocked the shot after it hit the glass. But the play could not be reviewed because goaltending was not originally called by the officials. Tyrese Maxey goes for the game-winnerBlocked by Kevin Durant Goaltend couldn’t be reviewedOvertimepic.twitter.com/7Zm1MnPIdv— Underdog NBA (@UnderdogNBA) January 23, 2026On the rebound after Durant's block, the Rockets were awarded a timeout even though they didn't have clear possession of the ball. Had Houston not been allowed to call timeout, Sixers rookie VJ Edgecombe had an open 3-pointer that could have won the game. Instead, the officials reviewed the play and said an inadvertent whistle had been blown. That resulted in a jump ball at mid-court with 1.3 seconds left. Kelly Oubre Jr. got the ball, but Philadelphia could not get a shot off before time expired in regulation. “Look, they are supposed to call those,” 76ers coach Nick Nurse said afterwards, via The Athletic. “If it is even close, they are supposed to call those and then go and review and get the play right. They should have called it in order to get the play right.”In overtime, the Sixers quickly took a 5-point lead on a 3 from Paul George and layup by Edgecombe. Houston quickly tied the score at 120-120 on a Durant 3 and Amen Thompson layup. Philadelphia then outscored the Rockets 6-2 during the final two minutes to take a 4-point lead. A Maxey dunk with 6.4 seconds remaining clinched the game for the 76ers. https://t.co/lueR2Lk1TRpic.twitter.com/7l4jSPvgDs— Philadelphia 76ers (@sixers) January 23, 2026Maxey scored six points in overtime to finish with 36, 10 assists and 4 steals.

And George finished with 10 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists. With the win, Philadelphia improved 24-19 to move ahed of the Cleveland Cavaliers for the No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Cavs host the Sacramento Kings on Friday. The 76ers host the New York Knicks on Saturday with a chance to pull the Knicks, who have lost nine of their past 12 games, further down the standings.Durant led the Rockets with 36 points (making 5-of-8 3s) and 7 rebounds. Thompson added 17 points, 6 boards and 9 assists, while Reed Sheppard scored 14 (with 4-of-7 3-pointers) off the bench. Alperen Şengün, Jabari Smith Jr. and Tari Eason each finished with 13 points. Houston dropped to 26-16 with the defeat and could fall behind the Los Angeles Lakers to the No. 5 spot in the West, pending the Lakers' matchup on Thursday with the Los Angeles Clippers.",

    "description": "Kuminga had 10 points in nine minutes Thursday night after going for 20 points in 21 minutes in a loss to the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday.",
    "content_html": "Just as Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga was finding a groove, he found himself back on the bench, this time because of left knee soreness that he sustained, along with a twisted left ankle, on a second-quarter drive during a 123-115 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday night.While Kuminga briefly remained in the game, he hit the locker room before halftime and didn't return to action. He's dealing with a minor knee hyperextension, according to ESPN's Anthony Slater, who reported that the injury isn't believed to be serious.Kuminga's setback occurred in the Warriors' second game since losing six-time All-Star Jimmy Butler III for the season because of a torn ACL.Here is the play where Jonathan Kuminga injured what looks to be his ankle.He remained in the game for a couple minutes but has since been subbed out… pic.twitter.com/1uHcPE6Ab6— SleeperWarriors (@SleeperWarriors) January 23, 2026Butler's absence opened the door for Kuminga to play again. Kuminga, whom the Warriors selected No. 7 overall in the 2021 draft, endured a contract dispute this offseason. Then he requested a trade last week after being relegated to the Warriors' bench.But, after 16 straight DNPs, Kuminga was firmly back in the rotation. He went for 20 points in 21 minutes Tuesday in a loss to the Toronto Raptors and was following up that performance with another head-turning outing versus the Mavericks (19-26), who have now won four games in a row.[Get more Warriors news: Golden State team feed]Kuminga checked in with 5:04 to go in the first quarter and immediately ignited an 8-0 Warriors run that he fueled with a pair of and-1s, the first on a jumper and the next on a layup.That flurry of points gave Golden State (25-21) a lead. Steve Kerr's group recovered after missing its first six shots. It took nearly six minutes for a Warriors player not named Stephen Curry to put the ball through the net.In fact, Curry converted three of his first four field-goal attempts — all three makes were from deep, including a 28-footer — while his teammates began the night 0 of 8 from the field.That was a sign of things to come. Curry made eight triples. The rest of the team made seven. Curry scored 38 points. The only other Warriors player to score more than 12 was De'Anthony Melton. He pitched in 22 points.Dallas, on the other hand, had four players pile up at least 19 points, namely Naji Marshall, who stood out with 30 points, 9 assists and 7 rebounds. Cooper Flagg grabbed 21 points and 11 rebounds.While the Warriors entered the second quarter with a lead in hand, they experienced more shooting woes. They wound up finishing the first half with a mere 34.7% field goal percentage. They shot only 6 of 25 from beyond the arc over the first two quarters.Flagg, who reeled in nine first-half rebounds, really made his mark in the second quarter. He followed a Klay Thompson missed 3 with a putback dunk. He also negated a Draymond Green block with an offensive rebound and clean-up basket inside. Soon after, he flung a pass to Thompson for a 3. Dallas dominated the second-chance points category, 24-5.Cooper Flagg on cleanup duty 😤Tap to watch on Prime: https://t.co/aHcBnUOdUspic.twitter.com/bZfIXUCwLu— NBA (@NBA) January 23, 2026Kuminga's final highlight before his early exit was an alley-oop dunk that he hammered home with one hand.In part thanks to a pair of 3s from Max Christie, the Mavericks turned a four-point deficit into a five-point halftime lead. The fourth-year guard clocked out with 21 points and 5 of 12 from downtown.Golden State rediscovered its stroke after intermission. It helped that Curry went off for 13 of the team's 39 points in the third quarter, which the Warriors ended by outscoring the Mavericks 17-7.But their streaky offense came back to bite them.They went more than two and a half minutes without a point in the back half of the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Dallas scored 11 straight, and Green committed a pair of fouls, including a flagrant 1. Green ultimately fouled out with 3:50 remaining with only 4 points, 4 rebounds and 5 assists to his name.Minutes before that, Mavericks big man Dwight Powell converted an and-1 despite bobbling a pass from Marshall, who rounded out the scoring spree by knifing through the paint for a layup.Curry interrupted the Golden State dry spell by raining down another 3. He simply didn't have enough help on Thursday, however.The Warriors missed Butler, and eventually Kuminga as well.Kerr told reporters that Kuminga will have an MRI on Friday.\"We'll see how bad it is,\" Kerr said, per The San Francisco Standard's Danny Emerman. \"Such a shame. He was playing great. That definitely hurt us, not having him available for the second half.\"",

    "content_html": "Every NBA team in the Western Conference has played 41 games and most have played more, which means we are due for a midseason report card. (Check out our East report card and midseason awards, too.)The Oklahoma City Thunder (37-8) went 6-6 over a three-week stretch during the holidays and still hold a commanding lead on the conference’s No. 1 seed. That stretch, though, included four losses to would-be challengers, leaving open the possibility they aren’t such a clear-cut favorite.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]The Denver Nuggets (29-15), who are surviving a spell without Nikola Jokić, the world’s best player, look every bit the contender when healthy. The San Antonio Spurs (30-14) handed OKC three of those losses, making clear that they could compete in a seven-game series with the defending champions. The Minnesota Timberwolves (27-17) also recently upset the Thunder.Each of those four teams, all serious contenders, warrants an A. The West also boasts the one F from our midseason report card, but before we give away too much, let us get to the grades.Dallas Mavericks • Denver Nuggets • Golden State Warriors • Houston Rockets • Los Angeles Clippers • Los Angeles Lakers • Memphis Grizzlies • Minnesota Timberwolves • New Orleans Pelicans • Oklahoma City Thunder • Phoenix Suns • Portland Trail Blazers • Sacramento Kings • San Antonio Spurs • Utah Jazz(First-quarter grades can be found here.)(Mallory Bielecki/Yahoo Sports Illustration)Dallas Mavericks (18-26)Midseason MVP: Cooper Flagg (19-6-4 on 48/29/81)Offensive rating: 110.4 (27th) • Defensive rating: 112.6 (7th)Best lineup: Flagg • Ryan Nembhard • Naji Marshall • P.J. Washington • Anthony Davis (+29 in 47 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 9-15 • Against losing teams: 9-11Comments: Anthony Davis is one of the few true game-changing forces in the NBA, only he cannot stay healthy, and he turns 33 years old in March. … This time, it is a hand injury that will keep him out through the All-Star break. … Shop him? For what? … The alternative: Keep him, get Kyrie Irving healthy, and see what you have with them and Cooper Flagg(!) next season. … What is the point of chasing a play-in bid? May as well add another high pick to their mix.Grade: DDenver Nuggets (29-15)Midseason MVP: Nikola Jokić (30-12-11 on 61/44/85)Offensive rating: 121.5 (1st) • Defensive rating: 117.0 (24th)Best lineup: Jokić • Jamal Murray • Christian Braun • Cam Johnson • Aaron Gordon (+42 in 159 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 13-8 • Against losing teams: 16-7Comments: Nikola Jokić leads the NBA in assists and rebounds per game and true shooting percentage. Needless to say, nobody has done that. … He is nursing a knee injury, and Denver (somehow) is 7-5 in his absence, holding on to the No. 3 seed in the West. … It speaks to the team’s depth this season. … The emergence of Peyton Watson (22-6-3 on 50/42/71) over those last 12 games is beyond helpful. … When healthy, this is as true of a contender as there is in the league. Grade: AGolden State Warriors (25-20)Midseason MVP: Stephen Curry (27-4-5 on 47/39/93)Offensive rating: 115.8 (12th) • Defensive rating: 112.8 (9th)Best lineup: Curry • Brandin Podziemski • Jimmy Butler • Jonathan Kuminga • Draymond Green (+25 in 65 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 11-15 • Against losing teams: 14-5Comments: Man, news of Jimmy Butler’s torn ACL is a bummer. … The framework of these Warriors, knocking on the door of the top-10 on both offense and defense, was a good one. … Stephen Curry is a shooting machine. This is not normal for a 37-year-old. … Yet, Golden State has been outscored by 2.7 points per 100 possessions when Butler is not on the court. … The dynasty, for all intents and purposes, is completely cooked, if it wasn’t already. … This is sad.Grade: CHouston Rockets (26-15)Midseason MVP: Kevin Durant (26-5-5 on 51/40/89)Offensive rating: 118.9 (3rd) • Defensive rating: 112.4 (5th)Best lineup: Durant • Amen Thompson • Josh Okogie • Jabari Smith Jr. • Alperen Şengün (+36 in 276 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 14-8 • Against losing teams: 12-7Comments: Without the injured Fred VanVleet, the Rockets lack an organizer of a point guard, and they have done quite well to survive it, posting the NBA’s third-rated offense. … Still, there are times in the clutch, where the Rockets are 10-12, when it is clear they need one. … It helps to have Kevin Durant, one of history’s most lethal isolation scorers — still, at 37 years old. Not normal, either, by the way. … It would be nice if coach Ime Udoka trusted Reed Sheppard more.Grade: BLos Angeles Clippers (19-24)Midseason MVP: Kawhi Leonard (28-6-4 on 50/40/94)Offensive rating: 115.5 (13th) • Defensive rating: 116.8 (22nd)Best lineup: Leonard • James Harden • Kris Dunn • John Collins • Ivica Zubac (+10 in 250 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 9-17 • Against losing teams: 10-7Comments: The Clippers earned an F on our first-quarter report card and deserved it. … Since then, they are 13-8, outscoring opponents by 2.7 points per 100 possessions — something like a playoff team. … Only their terrible start has left them clutching to a play-in tournament berth. … It is incumbent upon the Clippers to make the playoffs, if only so they do not hand their lottery pick to the Thunder. … Kawhi Leonard’s knee is acting up again. … The team is, plainly, too old.Grade: DLos Angeles Lakers (26-16)Midseason MVP: Luka Dončić (34-8-9 on 47/34/79)Offensive rating: 116.9 (8th) • Defensive rating: 117.3 (25th)Best lineup: Dončić • Austin Reaves • Marcus Smart • Rui Hachimura • Deandre Ayton (+31 in 81 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 10-11 • Against losing teams: 16-5Comments: The Lakers are 13-1 in the clutch, because they have Luka Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves, an incredible offensive trio, who know how to close games. … This is how they are in fifth place, in line to make the playoffs, despite a negative point differential. … When James, Dončić and Reaves share the floor, the Lakers allow 118.7 points per 100 possessions, the equivalent of a bottom-five defense. … This is, to be clear, a fatal flaw. JJ Redick knows this.Grade: BMemphis Grizzlies (18-24)Midseason MVP: Jaren Jackson Jr. (19-6-2 on 48/37/77)Offensive rating: 112.9 (23rd) • Defensive rating: 114.0 (14th)Best lineup: Jackson • Vince Williams • Cedric Coward • Jaylen Wells • Zach Edey (+27 in 102 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 5-20 • Against losing teams: 13-4Comments: In two games since returning to Memphis’ lineup, Ja Morant has totaled 47 points and 25 assists. … It feels like an audition for the rest of the league. … After all, the Grizzlies are reportedly listening to offers for Morant, and he seems ready to move on from Memphis, too. … The market is tepid.

    "description": "The Warriors have a tough decision ahead of them in the aftermath of Jimmy Butler&#39;s injury.",
    "content_html": "As soon as Jimmy Butler crumbled to the floor against the Miami Heat on Monday, Warriors center Quinten Post knew it wasn’t good. Butler screeched in pain holding his right knee, while Post, just a few inches away, stood in fear grabbing the back of his head with both hands. When Butler went down, so too did the Warriors’ chances of making a deep run this season. That’s the cruel thing about it all. The Warriors had emerged as a legitimate West threat. With a three-point lead at the time of Butler’s injury, the Warriors were on their way to their 12th win in 16 games, having established themselves as a top-5 defense with a still-incandescent Stephen Curry powering the attack. Twenty-four hours later, the wound left by Butler’s absence was gashed wide open. The Warriors gave up 145 points to the visiting Toronto Raptors, the most the Warriors had surrendered in a non-overtime game in over 15 seasons. Reeling from Butler’s injury on the second night of a back-to-back, they couldn’t stop the bleeding.If there is a silver lining to the Butler torn ACL, it is the calendar. There is no opportune time to tear an ACL, certainly not at Butler’s age (36), but the Warriors have some time before the Feb. 5 trade deadline to figure out what’s next.(Hayden Hodge/Yahoo Sports Illustration)At 37, Curry has turned back the clock, improving his scoring average to 27.1 points per game, the most he’s registered since the 2022-23 season. He is now the oldest player to ever average 27 points per game, per Stathead.com tracking. Scoring this much at this age is not something LeBron, KD, MJ or Kobe has ever done. To put it in perspective, Ray Allen, to whom Curry was often compared to earlier in his career, has never averaged 27 points per game, period.Which is why the Warriors have a tough decision ahead of them. Do they maximize Curry’s title window or preserve the post-Curry war chest?Here are three pathways for the Warriors in the aftermath of Butler’s injury.Path 1: Wait for Butler to come backThe Jimmy Butler trade last year had its doubters, but you can’t deny he changed the Warriors’ trajectory. Over the last two seasons, with Butler in the lineup, the Warriors are 44-16, which translates to a 55-win pace over 82 games. Without Butler in the lineup, the Warriors are 3-6, which … not good.For Warriors owner Joe Lacob and general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr., the Curry-Butler-Draymond Green trio is worth clinging to, at least in theory. Butler’s contract owes him $54 million this season and $57.1 million next season, and there was always a downside that, for all of Butler’s talents, things could go poorly. Trading for a 35-year-old with hard miles on the tires always comes with risk, even for someone as competitive and fiery as Butler.But the research of Jeff Stotts of InStreetClothes.com can’t be ignored. Since Stotts has meticulously kept tabs on NBA injuries since the 2005-06 season, no player has ever come back from an ACL injury at Butler’s age. At 36, Butler is the second-oldest player to have suffered the injury, behind only Chris “Birdman” Andersen, who tore his ACL in December of 2016 at 38 years old. Andersen never played again.There is reason for optimism, though. Andersen was never the caliber of player that Butler is. When Andersen tore his ACL, he was playing on a one-year commitment signed for the veteran’s minimum. Without a contract in hand, it’s understandable why Andersen hung it up for good. Butler, on the other hand, has the opportunity to come back to a team led by Curry and Green for one last hurrah. Notably, all three players are on expiring deals next season.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Dunleavy has made sure to keep the powder keg dry. The only pick the Warriors owe is a top-20 protected 2030 pick to Washington as part of the Chris Paul trade which will simply convert to a second-round pick if it doesn’t convey. For his part, Dunleavy has said he plans on Butler coming back to the Warriors next season. Dunleavy’s unwillingness to trade first-round picks down the road is a signal that he wants to maintain long-term sustainability rather than go all in for the twilight of Curry’s career. You can read it that way. But there may be another way to view it.Path 2: Trade for another star nowAn alternate interpretation of the Warriors’ stingy handling of first-round picks: They need them for one last big swing. The Butler contract, with one more year left after this season, could be appealing if another team needs to pivot away from a star player and wants to offload long-term money. Luckily for the Warriors, there are a few options here.Let’s run through a couple.The Anthony Davis trade (and Klay reunion)Warriors receive: Anthony Davis, Klay Thompson, Dante ExumMavericks receive: Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga and a top-four protected 2028 first-round pick from Golden StateNets receive: D’Angelo Russell and a lottery-protected 2026 first-round pick from Golden StateIs it risky for Golden State? Yes. Is it sentimental? Sure. Is it a bad idea? I don’t think so. Keeping Butler for the next two seasons may be the easiest but also the worst option on the table. You have to do right by Curry. If he wants to keep contending at the highest level in Golden State, this is a no-brainer. Especially since Davis and Curry have a relationship already. Davis, Curry and coach Steve Kerr won gold together in the 2024 Paris Olympics, so it’s not like this would be the first time they’ve come together to win it all. It needs to be pointed out that Davis is out for at least another month with a hand injury. While that timetable is not ideal, one month is way better than the potential 12-month layoff for Butler at the same salary. At 32 years old, Davis is hardly the most reliable star from a player health standpoint, but at least the finger injury won’t affect his wheels. The same can’t be said for Butler upon his return.Like Butler, Davis would be a floor-raiser star for the Warriors, who are operating on a much different timeline than Dallas now that the Mavs have Cooper Flagg. Davis has a $62.8 million player option for 2027-28, which may not be palatable for Dallas. In Golden State, with Curry still playing at a high level, that might be the price of maximizing Curry’s pursuit for a fifth championship.[Get more Warriors news: Golden State team feed]The Davis acquisition would also help keep Green fresher since neither of them want to play the 5 full-time and they can share the burden of the center position. With Davis occupying the block, a floor-spacing wing like Thompson becomes even more essential. His emotional return would be icing on the cake both in nostalgia and need. WIth deals all expiring in 2026-27, I could see Curry, Green and Thompson taking below-market deals to keep it going.On the Dallas side, the Mavs free themselves of Davis’ monster player option in 2027-28 and take a low-commitment chance on Kuminga, who is still 23 years old. Butler’s expiring contract could be flipped again at next year’s deadline to a contender with draft assets. In the meantime, Butler and Kyrie Irving could both rehab from their respective ACL tears. Without control over their first-round picks from 2027 to 2030, the time for Dallas’ ping-pong prioritization is now.To facilitate the deal, the Nets receive D’Angelo Russell for a third time. Because why not. They could either waive him or keep him for yet another go around on the Russell carousel. For their services, the Warriors would send a heavily protected first-round pick.The Zion Williamson and Trey Murphy III trade (and Kevon Looney reunion)Warriors receive: Zion Williamson, Trey Murphy III and Kevon LooneyPelicans receive: Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, two first-round picks (2026 and 2032) and a 2027 first-round pick swapNets receive: Jordan Hawkins and a 2028 top-20 protected pickDunleavy told reporters on Tuesday that he wouldn’t be looking to trade a post-Steph first-round pick unless he was getting a big-time player in return.\"If we're talking about trading draft picks that will be going out when Steph isn't here, it's going to have to be a player that we think we'll be getting back that is going to be here when those picks are going out,\" Dunleavy said. \"That player's going to have to be pretty impactful. It would take a good amount — positionally, play style, archetype, all that. I would leave it pretty broad and open.\"But if there's a great player to be had, we've got everything in the war chest that we would be willing to use.\"Do Zion Williamson or Trey Murphy III qualify? Maybe not individually. But if you’re getting both? Absolutely. According to Chris Haynes, the Pelicans are not trading their core group, but goodness gracious, the Zion Williamson experience has run its course in New Orleans. The team has lost 14 of its last 16 games with Williamson in uniform (he left Wednesday’s game early with an illness). The only wins have come against … Brooklyn and Washington. It’s way past time to blow it up and move on from the former No. 1 overall pick now that he’s healthy and easier to trade.Williamson and Murphy are both 25 years old and too talented to be floundering on a team clearly building around rookies Jeremiah Fears and Derik Queen. Insert Zion and TM3 in the Warriors’ championship culture and it wouldn’t surprise me at all to see them blossom into winning contributors on a playoff team. As a bonus, they’re young enough to be the bridge to the post-Steph era and experienced enough to be win-now players.Of course, like Davis, Williamson is an injury wild card. Taking on a talent like Williamson would be a bet on Warriors director of sports medicine and performance Rick Celebrini to get Williamson back on track and keep him there. It’s a risk, but would you rather have Butler’s lost salary and Kuminga or the upside of Williamson and Murphy? I know what I would choose. And Kevon Looney coming back to the Bay? Imagine that standing ovation.As for the Pelicans, they can use the Warriors’ unprotected 2026 pick as a soft landing from the fallout of trading its 2026 “super first” pick to Atlanta that has Milwaukee swap rights. As of now, the Pelicans have no first-round pick in the 2026 draft; the Warriors can change that. While they unload two lob threats for Queen, they acquire one in Kuminga, who is younger, similarly athletic and needs a fresh start.Path 3: Revisit this offseasonButler’s contract seems like an albatross now, with over $100 million combined coming to him this season and next. But as soon as the NBA fiscal calendar turns this offseason, Butler’s expiring contract could become a lot more appealing to teams looking to cleanse their long-term cap sheet. Would Utah want to move Lauri Markkanen’s long-term deal? What about Cleveland and Evan Mobley if they flame out again? What about Giannis? Those questions may get a hard no now, but that calculus could change over the summer. Especially if Kuminga balls out the rest of the season.While it seems like the Warriors caught a break by having this injury happen now rather than after the deadline, two weeks may be too quick for a Butler market to materialize. There are so many unknowables right now. I would be shocked if Butler hung it up for good like Andersen, especially since he vowed on Instagram to “be back before you know it.”Questions will be surrounding him for the foreseeable future. How’s his rehab going? Will he be back in time for the 2026-27 deadline? Will he be back at all for next season?These are questions that don’t have answers now. But this summer, a return-to-play program will come into focus and help teams chart their future. Any team looking to play Butler next season or flip him to a contender will want to know his plan and status for next season as soon as possible. In that sense, two weeks doesn’t seem like a lot of time at all. If they take this path, the Warriors could look at the rest of the 2025-26 season as something of a reset. Don’t run Curry and Green into the ground and keep an eye for the future. If it ends up delivering more ping-pong balls on draft night, so be it.Another thing: if the Warriors go all in now, the 2026 first-round pick becomes less attractive to teams. As I mentioned earlier and outlined on the Big Number on Wednesday, the Warriors are 3-6 without Butler in uniform since they acquired him at last year’s trade deadline. If they continue at a similar pace, they could end up with a lottery pick. Any trade talks involving absorbing Butler’s contract will become that much sweeter if it’s a known lottery pick as opposed to a late first-rounder. With that said, of all the options outlined here, I’m pushing hard for Path 2. Stephen Curry is the principal reason the Warriors currently rank as the most valuable franchise in the sport. They have to do right by him and go for it while he’s still (inexplicably) an All-NBA player. If I’m the front office, I’d call up Pelicans president of basketball operations Joe Dumars and go for the Pelicans move above as a top priority now. If talks don’t result in a move now, it could happen later. Sometimes the trade deadline is just setting the stage for summer fireworks. Stay tuned.",

That was the most important thing, just finding a way to break the ice and get one in the left column,\" Karl-Anthony Towns said, via The Associated Press. \"So good game, good day for us to show what we're capable of, but consistency is what makes champions and we've got to find that consistency and bring this kind of intensity and energy and execution every single night.\"The Knicks led almost the entire way on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, and they opened the contest on an 18-6 run. They held the Nets to just 18 points in the second quarter, which sent them into the locker room with a 22-point lead, and then pushed that to 32 points by the end of the third period.Brunson and the rest of the Knicks starters were pulled at that point, but their reserves still opened the fourth quarter on a 16-0 tear to secure the blowout win.Brunson had 20 points and five assists to lead the Knicks. Landry Shamet added 18 points off the bench, shooting a perfect 6-of-6 from behind the arc, and Towns added 14 points and eight rebounds.

    "description": "Jeanie Buss reportedly soured on LeBron James after the Russell Westbrook trade.",
    "content_html": "The Los Angeles Lakers returned to notoriety when the team signed superstar LeBron James in free agency ahead of the 2018-19 NBA season. While that partnership turned out well initially — with James leading the team to a championship in his second season — Lakers owner Jeanie Buss reportedly began to sour on James, per ESPN's Baxter Holmes. That tidbit was revealed as part of a much larger piece on the Buss' family drama and how it led to the team being sold to Mark Walter. While there are plenty of juicy revelations in the article, Buss' relationship with James will likely draw the most attention.Buss' opinion of James reportedly started to change after the Lakers traded for Russell Westbrook in 2021. The move, which the team made to make James happy, backfired. Westbook's fit on the Lakers was awkward, and the team failed to make the playoffs after acquiring the veteran. Buss reportedly was frustrated with the way James washed his hands of the deal and blamed others after it failed, per ESPN.[Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed]Buss reportedly even considered trading James at one point — with the Los Angeles Clippers being the most likely destination. That didn't happen, and James inserted a no-trade clause into his 2024 extension, making a deal impossible now unless James approves it. The relationship further soured after the Lakers drafted James' son, Bronny, in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft. Buss reportedly felt LeBron should have been more grateful the team picked his son in the draft, per ESPN.\"And when the Lakers drafted James' son, Bronny, with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn't, people close to the team told ESPN.\"Bronny, 21, has been used in a reserve role in the NBA. He's averaged 1.9 points in 51 career games. Buss released a statement to The Athletic refuting the claim about James, saying: “It’s really not right, given all the great things LeBron has done for the Lakers, that he has to be pulled into my family drama. To say that it wasn’t appreciated is just not true and completely unfair to him.”But if the report is true, Buss and James could be heading for a clean break in the offseason. James' contract is up at the end of the season, allowing the 41-year-old to easily leave the team in the offseason. James has still performed well this season and has helped the Lakers to a 26-16 start. If he wants to keep playing, James could almost certainly find a job with another franchise.But it's unclear whether James will do that. The 23-year veteran has not addressed his future in the NBA past the 2025-26 season. If James does come back for one more year, it's possible he once again considers the Lakers. But if Wednesday's report is accurate, James' return to Los Angeles could be dependent on whether Buss, who remains the team's governor and minority owner, can still co-exist with the superstar.",

    "description": "With the trade deadline approaching, we ponder the teams and situations that could be active.",
    "content_html": "The NBA trade deadline is Feb. 5. Let’s dive into the chatter and try to make sense of it all. Morten Stig Jensen: All right, Kelly. The NBA trade deadline is just two weeks away, and we've already seen Trae Young change addresses, with Ja Morant and Anthony Davis rumored to follow suit. But instead of regurgitating those same two names, I'm wondering if we should identify teams that are just generally in need of doing … well, something!Detroit is No. 1 in the East, and that's obviously good, but I can't escape the feeling they aren't that heavy in the talent department. [Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Tobias Harris’ expiring contract, worth over $26.6 million, could be a big trade chip, and now is the time to do something as Jalen Duren is going to earn a new paycheck this coming summer. Lauri Markkanen is a name often bandied about in connection with the Pistons, but should they even try to enter into negotiations with Danny Ainge? Kelly Iko: The Pistons are having a historic season, are loaded with young talent and have the league’s second-ranked defense. It would be an absolute buzzkill for them to stand pat before the trade deadline. From an offensive standpoint, Detroit is kind of meh. They’re 26th in offensive rating since Jan. 1, 23rd in halfcourt points per possession, 26th in 3-point attempt rate and 22nd in 3-point makes. In a perfect world, Cade Cunningham would be this prolific driver, drawing downhill gravity and spraying out to shooters on the perimeter who could either knock down catch-and-shoot looks or create their own if the defense adjusts. According to Second Spectrum, Cunningham is fifth in drives per game (16.8), but the difference between him and, say, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, is stark. Cunningham shoots 10% worse on drives and 10% worse at the free-throw line than SGA.The playoffs are essentially a math problem and when the book is out on Detroit — swarm Cunningham at the point of attack and dare their role players to make shots — the issues could come quickly. Houston’s 2024-25 season comes to mind: exciting young core with a kick-ass defense that struggles in the halfcourt. That was a first-round exit. Pistons ratingsSo yes, I think Markkanen makes sense in a lot of ways as a jumbo creator with uber-spacing ability. Ditto for Michael Porter Jr. and Trey Murphy. Yahoo Sports’ Kevin O’Connor recently put together a nice list of names the Pistons should be chasing, but the overarching theme is as awesome as Detroit has been for a refreshing storyline, this is anything but a perfect team. Back to you, Mort. Who’s second on your list and why? Perhaps a team out West …Mort: Sir, if you're insinuating that I should bring up the Spurs here, I shan't disappoint. This team is just so far ahead of where most had them pegged at this stage, and that leads to a similar conclusion as you had with Detroit. It'd be a buzzkill if they didn't do, well, something.So let me throw something your way that's proper insanity. The Spurs need a more-than-solid wing big if they are to constantly go up against the Oklahoma City Thunder. We can sit here all day and talk about short-term solutions and who might come cheaper on the trade front, but let's kill that noise and go all in. Deni Avdija. The Blazers have zero — and I mean ZERO — interest in moving off their 26/7/7 wing, who should make his first All-Star team this season.As such, the Spurs need to make what we rarely see anymore: the Godfather offer. Kelly Olynyk for salary-matching and damn near every tradable pick under the sun, in particular the juicy ones, such as Atlanta's 2027, a future Kings swap option and some of their own in the 2030s.They're clearly moving off Jeremy Sochan, and while Harrison Barnes is one of the best role players in the league, he's getting up there in age. There's going to be a need for a wing big who can play power forward, and they need someone who can shoot, handle the ball and initiate plays in such a role. Why not make a play for a guy who fits the timeline, is dirt cheap ($13.1 million in 2026-2027 and $11.8 million in 2027-28) and could realistically catapult you into championship contention this very season? At the very least, the Blazers can receive the offer. If they wish to stick with Avdija, which I think we both could understand, then so be it. But it'd show some aggressiveness on behalf of the Spurs in trying to fulfill their mission as soon as possible and while Victor Wembanyama is still young and (relatively) healthy. (I don't want to put the injury hex on him, but let's be real. Human beings who are 7-feet-5 and play professional sports historically play fewer years than, say, smaller lead guards.)Iko: Love the idea of Avdija in San Antonio. So much of what the Spurs do — from a non-Wemby and offensive balance vantage point — revolves around the proficiency of their guard play. Bringing in a taller initiator with legit three-level scoring ability would give them an added wrinkle while still keeping their spacing in Devin Vassell and Julian Champagnie. Here’s my devil’s advocate question for you, though. We just named two teams that could benefit from pulling the trade trigger. But what about the teams that would be letting these assets go? Is there a world where the Blazers ponder what Avdija looks like next to a healthy Damian Lillard? Is there a world where the Jazz start to actually build around Markkanen and Keyonte George? Or are those teams destined for NBA purgatory and should flip their hot commodities while they still can? Mort: I usually want teams in NBA purgatory to not go all in, as that often insinuates they don't have their leading man. (Neither the Blazers nor Jazz are in purgatory due to their situations, but it's fair to wonder if their ultimate ceiling is capped as none of Avdija, Markkanen or George projects as a Tier 1 superstar.) However. Allow me to just bring up the Bulls for a second. We don't assume competence on their part, and probably rightly so, but have you seen the situation they're in? If new leadership were to take over, it'd be licking its chops: an enormous bundle of expiring contracts, upward of $80-plus million, control of all of their picks and even some youngsters with trade value. Is this a team that should take a step back and build even more draft equity? Probably, but that's never been its favorite song. Instead, this leadership has a history of buying and leaning into some questionable upgrades, such as Nikola Vučević at the trade deadline in 2021, when they then followed up in free agency by acquiring both Lonzo Ball and DeMar DeRozan. Is this on-the-fence team one we should keep an eye on? Generally speaking, I'm curious how teams with numerous trade assets will decide to act before Feb. 5. Do they see this as a means of buying low on, say, Zion Williamson or Ja Morant? Williamson is reportedly off the table in trade negotiations, but excuse my French when I say, “Baloney!” Personally, I don't think it's a smart strategy, but reasonable people can disagree, and we must at least acknowledge there is star quality attached to both names. Iko: Ironically, we talked about Chicago prior to the season. These sneaky Bulls always mosey their way into the conversation.I’m generally wary of anything going on in the Windy City (DJ Moore routes included), but if I’m in the Bulls’ front office and I’m pondering whether to make a move for Morant or Williamson, why not just go for both? It sounds ludicrous until you actually give it some thought. Health and availability is obviously the biggest factor in moving for either of these players, but they’re still young enough (Zion, 25; Morant, 26) where you could sell a core along with Matas Buzelis, who’s been a bright spot and showcased some underrated defensive versatility. Again, this only works if you can guarantee that both play in at least 65 games (big if), but I’m tired of the Bulls being boring. Shoot for the oft-injured stars. On a more serious note, I appreciate how each team approaches this time of the year. The rumor mill can get a bit mundane, but at least if you sift through enough, you’ll get an understanding of individual organizational goals and objectives. It should be a fun two weeks.",

    "description": "Which East teams deserve the highest marks at the regular season&#39;s midway point?",
    "content_html": "Every team in the Eastern Conference has played at least 41 games, which means we have reached the NBA regular season’s midway point, which means it is high time for a report card. (Our midseason awards can be found here.)The Detroit Pistons (31-10), led on offense by Cade Cunningham and owners of the East’s best defense, are running away with the No. 1 seed, holding on to a 5.5-game lead in the conference.Still, the East is as wide open as it has ever been. The second-place and surprising Boston Celtics (26-16) could return Jayson Tatum for the fourth quarter of this season. The New York Knicks (25-18) have been floundering, but we know what they are capable of when they are firing on all cylinders. Same goes for the sloooowly getting better Cleveland Cavaliers (24-20).[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Meanwhile, the Philadelphia 76ers (23-19) and Orlando Magic (23-19) are lurking, if only they could stay healthy. Then there are the Toronto Raptors (26-19), who are as plucky as anybody.We have yet to see a team in the East that has made the statement: We are prepared to battle whomever emerges from the Western Conference in the NBA Finals. Maybe Detroit is THEM. The Pistons could use one more impact player, but that is for the trade deadline to determine.Now, though, it is time to get to the grades …Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards(Our first-quarter grades can be found here.)(Mallory Bielecki/Yahoo Sports Illustration)Atlanta Hawks (20-25)Midseason MVP: Jalen Johnson (23-10-8 on 51/36/78)Offensive rating: 113.4 (22nd) • Defensive rating: 114.8 (16th)Best lineup: Johnson • Nickeil Alexander-Walker • Dyson Daniels • Zaccharie Risacher • Kristaps Porziņģis (+19 in 129 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 11-18 • Against losing teams: 9-7Comments: Since trading Trae Young, the Hawks are 3-4, hardly the start they anticipated upon dealing the four-time All-Star point guard. … On the whole, they have been outscored by 1.4 points per 100 meaningful possessions when Young is not on the court, per Cleaning the Glass. … Atlanta was supposed to be a darkhorse candidate to emerge from the East. Instead, it looks like it could be bound for the play-in again. … Is another big move in development?Grade: DBoston Celtics (26-16)Midseason MVP: Jaylen Brown (30-7-5 on 49/36/79)Offensive rating: 121.4 (2nd) • Defensive rating: 114.0 (14th)Best lineup: Brown • Payton Pritchard • Derrick White • Sam Hauser • Neemias Queta (+53 in 134 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 13-12 • Against losing teams: 13-4Comments: The Celtics own the East’s second-best record and its second-best net rating, all in the absence of an injured Jayson Tatum. … Tatum’s return could be sooner than later. … Jaylen Brown has played his way into the MVP conversation. … Anfernee Simons and Sam Hauser have also played well enough for the Celtics to consider a) not moving either at the deadline or b) packaging one or both of them, along with picks, for a significant upgrade. … They could use another big.Grade: ABrooklyn Nets (12-29)Midseason MVP: Michael Porter Jr. (26-7-3 on 49/40/85)Offensive rating: 112.3 (25th) • Defensive rating: 117.4 (26th)Best lineup: Porter • Egor Demin • Tre Mann • Noah Clowney • Nicolas Claxton (+18 in 306 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 5-18 • Against losing teams: 7-11Comments: The Nets may have won their trade of Cam Johnson, given how well Michael Porter Jr. has played to this point and the fact that they received an additional first-round pick in the deal. … Porter might fetch more first-round assets if he is shopped by the deadline. … The Nets needed one of their five first-round picks to pop, and none of them has, though Egor Demin has played better of late (14-3-3 on 45/45/83 shooting splits in his last 14 appearances).Grade: CCharlotte Hornets (16-27)Midseason MVP: Kon Knueppel (19-5-4 on 49/44/89)Offensive rating: 116.9 (7th) • Defensive rating: 116.7 (21st)Best lineup: Knueppel • LaMelo Ball • Brandon Miller • Miles Bridges • Moussa Diabate (+63 in 112 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 7-16 • Against losing teams: 9-11Comments: Rookie wing Kon Knueppel, it seems, was a true find at the No. 4 draft slot. … Brandon Miller should be good, too. Together they are a decent foundation. … Is LaMelo Ball a part of that same foundation? He is reportedly open to a trade away from Charlotte, and it might be in the Hornets’ best interest to deal him. … They have not won with him. … Then again, they are +11.5 points per 100 meaningful possessions when Knueppel, Miller and Ball share a court.Grade: DChicago Bulls (21-22)Midseason MVP: Josh Giddey (19-9-9 on 47/39/76)Offensive rating: 114.4 (16th) • Defensive rating: 116.8 (23rd)Best lineup: Giddey • Matas Buzelis • Kevin Huerter • Isaac Okoro • Nikola Vučević (+5 in 65 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 10-11 • Against losing teams: 11-11Comments: Shocker of all shockers: The Bulls are hovering around .500 again, bound for another play-in tournament in a watered-down Eastern Conference, no chance at winning. … Lots to like about Matas Buzelis. … You can’t help but appreciate Nikola Vučević’s efforts, too, even as he seems endlessly frustrated by Chicago’s perpetual quest for mediocrity. … What to do with Coby White, a 2026 free agent? … The Bulls are full of questions, empty of answers. Grade: DCleveland Cavaliers (24-20)Midseason MVP: Donovan Mitchell (29-5-6 on 49/38/84)Offensive rating: 116.5 (10th) • Defensive rating: 114.6 (15th)Best lineup: Mitchell • Darius Garland • De’Andre Hunter • Evan Mobley • Jarrett Allen (+29 in 51 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 10-15 • Against losing teams: 14-5Comments: That redundancy of Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland in the backcourt and Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen in the frontcourt? Still a problem. … Far more of a problem than it was a year ago at this time, when the Cavs were bound for a 64-win campaign. … Then again, when all four are on the court, Cleveland is still +7.2 points per 100 meaningful possessions. … Maybe they need a wing. … Maybe they just need Garland healthy. … They need something.Grade: CDetroit Pistons (31-10)Midseason MVP: Cade Cunningham (26-6-10 on 45/33/82)Offensive rating: 116.0 (11th) • Defensive rating: 108.5 (2nd)Best lineup: Cunningham • Ausar Thompson • Duncan Robinson • Tobias Harris • Jalen Duren (+57 in 276 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 14-4 • Against losing teams: 17-6Comments: The Pistons own the East’s best record and best net rating. How could we complain? … Cade Cunningham has been everything Detroit could have asked for from its No. 1 pick. … Jalen Duren should be an All-Star. … They need to upgrade the Tobias Harris position if they want to seriously compete with the West. … Lauri Markkanen would be nice, but his cost is prohibitive. … Michael Porter Jr.? Now, he would establish them as clear favorites in the East.Grade: AIndiana Pacers (10-34)Midseason MVP: Pascal Siakam (24-7-4 on 48/38/68)Offensive rating: 107.9 (30th) • Defensive rating: 116.0 (19th)Best lineup: Siakam • Andrew Nembhard • Ben Sheppard • Bennedict Mathurin • Jay Huff (+9 in 39 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 3-25 • Against losing teams: 7-9Comments: Look at what the Celtics have done without Tatum, and look at what the Pacers have done without Tyrese Haliburton. … It’s not the worst-case scenario. Indiana has quickly pivoted to becoming a tanking team, once it became clear it had no chance of seriously competing for a playoff spot. … In that sense, they are a success, falling to the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, in line for a top-four overall pick. Could be a lot worse, actually.Grade: CMiami Heat (23-21)Midseason MVP: Norman Powell (24-4-3 on 49/42/85)Offensive rating: 113.7 (20th) • Defensive rating: 112.8 (8th)Best lineup: Powell • Tyler Herro • Davion Mitchell • Andrew Wiggins • Bam Adebayo (+27 in 94 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 10-18 • Against losing teams: 13-3Comments: The Heat installed a new, almost pick-and-roll-less offense, which was all the rage as the season began, only to settle in at 20th in the NBA on that end by midseason. … They still play at the fastest pace in the league — by a wide margin. … Norm Powell, the Clippers’ loss, is Miami’s gain. … Bam Adebayo, forever an anchor of a top-10 defense. … The Heat are 4-7 with Tyler Herro in the lineup and cannot find any sense of a rhythm as he battles a series of injuries.Grade: CMilwaukee Bucks (18-24)Midseason MVP: Giannis Antetokounmpo (29-10-6 on 65/40/65)Offensive rating: 113.0 (23rd) • Defensive rating: 116.1 (20th)Best lineup: Antetokounmpo • Ryan Rollins • Kevin Porter Jr. • AJ Green • Myles Turner (+44 in 173 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 6-18 • Against losing teams: 12-6Comments: The Bucks are performing like a top-tier team when Giannis Antetokounmpo is on the court, outscoring opponents by 6.9 points per 100 possessions. … They are operating like a bottom-dweller when he is on the bench, getting outscored by 9.5 points per 100 possessions. … Still, Antetokounmpo insists he will not ask out of Milwaukee, leaving that discussion to the team and his agents. … Might the Bucks make one more desperation move to satiate Giannis? Grade: DNew York Knicks (25-18)Midseason MVP: Jalen Brunson (28-3-6 on 48/39/85)Offensive rating: 118.9 (4th) • Defensive rating: 115.9 (18th)Best lineup: Brunson • Miles McBride • Josh Hart • Mikal Bridges • Karl-Anthony Towns (+45 in 118 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 11-13 • Against losing teams: 14-5Comments: The Knicks, who entered the season as betting favorites to win the East, are now staring up at Detroit in that regard. … They also trail the Tatum-less Celtics in the standings. … They are 2-9 with the 27th-ranked net rating (-8.4) in their last 11 games. … Newsday’s sources suggested the sharks are circling Karl-Anthony Towns, though another report shot down that idea. … It is hard to imagine the Knicks shaking up their core for anyone but Antetokounmpo.Grade: COrlando Magic (23-19)Midseason MVP: Paolo Banchero (21-9-5 on 45/27/76)Offensive rating: 114.4 (18th) • Defensive rating: 113.6 (12th)Best lineup: Banchero • Jalen Suggs • Desmond Bane • Franz Wagner • Wendell Carter Jr. (+47 in 117 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 12-12 • Against losing teams: 11-7Comments: Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero have played 16 games together; the Magic are 8-8 in those outings. … Hard to tell what Orlando is capable of, since Jalen Suggs has also had trouble staying on the court. … Anthony Black’s progress (16-4-4 on 47/36/73 shooting splits) is a revelation. … Of the 48 players who have taken 15 or more shots per game, Banchero ranks 44th in true shooting percentage (55%). … Can Orlando get back into the top 10 on defense?Grade: CPhiladelphia 76ers (23-19)Midseason MVP: Tyrese Maxey (30-4-7 on 47/40/88)Offensive rating: 114.4 (15th) • Defensive rating: 113.2 (11th)Best lineup: Maxey • VJ Edgecombe • Paul George • Dominick Barlow • Joel Embiid (+22 in 142 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 9-14 • Against losing teams: 14-5Comments: Tyrese Maxey, what a player. … VJ Edgecombe is going to be a heck of a backcourt partner to Maxey. The 76ers are set there. … Joel Embiid since mid-December: 28-8-4 on 51/30/86 splits, and he can barely even jump. Can he stay healthy through multiple rounds of playoffs? … Paul George is also contributing as somewhat of an outsized role player. … Who wants to face these Sixers in the first round? Just imagine if they acquire another wing.Grade: BToronto Raptors (26-19)Midseason MVP: Scottie Barnes (20-8-6 on 50/32/82)Offensive rating: 114.1 (19th) • Defensive rating: 112.5 (6th)Best lineup: Barnes • Immanuel Quickley • RJ Barrett • Brandon Ingram • Jakob Poeltl (+18 in 166 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 11-12 • Against losing teams: 15-7Comments: The Raptors own the league’s sixth-rated defense, and their rim protector, Jakob Poeltl, has not played since Dec. 21 … You can see why Toronto might be interested in Anthony Davis. … You can see why they might want Ja Morant, too, since the Immanuel Quickley spot could also be upgraded. … But who wants the three years left on his deal after this season? … Collectively, though, we couldn’t ask for much more from this team, especially Brandon Ingram.Grade: AWashington Wizards (10-32)Midseason MVP: Alex Sarr (17-7-3 on 51/35/70)Offensive rating: 109.6 (28th) • Defensive rating: 120.7 (29th)Best lineup: Sarr • Bub Carrington • Tre Johnson • Kyshawn George • Khris Middleton (-5 in 41 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 2-20 • Against losing teams: 8-12Comments: Is Trae Young ever going to play for this team this season? Maybe they will nurse his quad injury for as long as it takes to pull their tank into a bottom-four spot. … The Wizards are still waiting on a star to emerge from their recent string of first-round draft picks, though Alex Sarr (17-7-3 on 51/35/70 shooting splits and a league-leading 2.2 blocks per game) is a player. … Get Tre Johnson more shots than his 10 per game. … Another high-end lottery pick loading.Grade: B",

After the contest, Lakers head coach JJ Redick said Ayton looked \"like a pirate\" after leaving the contest just before halftime. Ayton did not play the entire third quarter due to the injury. Before the fourth quarter was over, the Lakers announced he would miss the rest of the contest. He finished with four points and eight rebounds in roughly 15 minutes during the Lakers' 115-107 win over the Denver Nuggets.While Redick said Ayton's eye was \"not in good shape\" after the game, the team doesn't expect Ayton to miss time. Redick added that the center \"will be fine\" ahead of Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers. Even if Ayton needs to miss that game, it doesn't sound like the eye injury will keep him sidelined for long. After spending the last two seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, Ayton joined the Lakers on a two-year deal in the offseason.

    "content_html": "Jimmy Butler's ACL tear is a devastating blow for the veteran All-Star and cause for a reckoning in Golden State over its plans to compete in the back-end of Stephen Curry's prime. General manager Mike Dunleavy was on hand Tuesday night to address the Warriors' short- and long-term plans ahead of Golden State's home game against the Toronto Raptors.He was asked about Butler's future with the franchise as well as that of disgruntled forward Jonathan Kuminga, who's been languishing on the bench amid poor play and a trade demand. And ... let's just say that he has divergent thoughts on Butler's and Kuminga's value on the basketball court.Dunleavy not ready to tear things downWith Butler's injury prompting chatter of a full teardown and the end of the era of competitive basketball with Curry, Dunleavy was asked about the prospect of trading away Butler's contract, which has one year and $56.8 million remaining beyond this season. Dunleavy said that he's not entertaining the idea.  \"I don't envision that,\" Dunleavy said. \"But now that you've brought it up, I guess I'd say what I envision for him is kind of giving us a boost next year the same way he did last year when he arrived. \"And so, at some point during the season, him returning and being the player he's been.\"Mike Dunleavy said he does not envision he will trade Jimmy Butler’s contract and believes Butler will rehab and return to help the team at some point next season pic.twitter.com/FjU1xzDnb6— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) January 21, 2026That sounds like a man not ready to wave the white flag on the Curry era. It also sounds like the words of an optimist. Butler will be 37 next season and coming off one of the most serious injuries in sports. Can Butler return to high-level basketball after ACL tear?Butler's been a boon for the Warriors and helped spark a run to the second round of the playoffs last season after arriving via a midseason trade. The Warriors made the playoffs as the No. 7 seed out of the play-in, then upset the No. 2 seed Rockets in the first round before falling to the Timberwolves in the second. Butler's arrival was a big reason for that success, and he was playing at an All-Star level this season (20 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 4.9 apg, 1.4 spg) before tearing his right ACL Monday night. If anyone's capable of returning from an ACL tear to play at a high level at 37 years old, Butler's the type of player to do it. And for now, at least, Dunleavy appears to be holding out hope that that's how things play out.The alternative is not an appealing option and one that could mean dealing Curry while he still has trade value. They are not ready for that in Golden State. What about Kuminga?As for the short-term, Butler's minutes just opened up, and they need to be filled. That could mean the end of Kuminga's relegation to the bench. Head coach Steve Kerr opened the door to that possibility, telling reporters that Kuminga \"could be\" part of the rotation in Butler's absence. That would require a willingness on both sides to thaw an icy relationship. Dunleavy doesn't sound eager to extend an olive branch. When asked about Kuminga's trade demand, Dunleavy suggested that Kuminga might not drum up much demand for his services.\"As far as the demand, I'm aware of that. In terms of demands, when you make a demand, there needs to be demand — on the market.\"Warriors GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. with a candid quote on Jonathan Kuminga's trade demand. pic.twitter.com/7iNoKxpd2z— KNBR (@KNBR) January 21, 2026\"I think as far as the demand — I'm aware of that,\" Dunleavy said. \"I think in terms of demands, when you make a demand, there needs to be demand on the market. So, we'll see where that unfolds.The NBA trade deadline is Feb. 5. The Warriors have a lot to figure out before then.",

    "description": "Jeanie Buss reportedly soured on LeBron James after the Russell Westbrook trade.",
    "content_html": "The Los Angeles Lakers returned to notoriety when the team signed superstar LeBron James in free agency ahead of the 2018-19 NBA season. While that partnership turned out well initially — with James leading the team to a championship in his second season — Lakers owner Jeanie Buss reportedly began to sour on James, per ESPN's Baxter Holmes. That tidbit was revealed as part of a much larger piece on the Buss' family drama and how it led to the team being sold to Mark Walter. While there are plenty of juicy revelations in the article, Buss' relationship with James will likely draw the most attention.Buss' opinion of James reportedly started to change after the Lakers traded for Russell Westbrook in 2021. The move, which the team made to make James happy, backfired. Westbook's fit on the Lakers was awkward, and the team failed to make the playoffs after acquiring the veteran. Buss reportedly was frustrated with the way James washed his hands of the deal and blamed others after it failed, per ESPN.[Get more Lakers news: Los Angeles team feed]Buss reportedly even considered trading James at one point — with the Los Angeles Clippers being the most likely destination. That didn't happen, and James inserted a no-trade clause into his 2024 extension, making a deal impossible now unless James approves it. The relationship further soured after the Lakers drafted James' son, Bronny, in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft. Buss reportedly felt LeBron should have been more grateful the team picked his son in the draft, per ESPN.\"And when the Lakers drafted James' son, Bronny, with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn't, people close to the team told ESPN.\"Bronny, 21, has been used in a reserve role in the NBA. He's averaged 1.9 points in 51 career games. If those reports are true, Buss and James could be heading for a clean break in the offseason. James' contract is up at the end of the season, allowing the 41-year-old to easily leave the team in the offseason. James has still performed well this season and has helped the Lakers to a 26-16 start. If he wants to keep playing, James could almost certainly find a job with another franchise.But it's unclear whether James will do that. The 23-year veteran has not addressed his future in the NBA past the 2025-26 season. If James does come back for one more year, it's possible he once again considers the Lakers. But if Wednesday's report is accurate, James' return to Los Angeles could be dependent on whether Buss, who remains the team's governor and minority owner, can still co-exist with the superstar.",

    "description": "With the trade deadline approaching, we ponder the teams and situations that could be active.",
    "content_html": "The NBA trade deadline is Feb. 5. Let’s dive into the chatter and try to make sense of it all. Morten Stig Jensen: All right, Kelly. The NBA trade deadline is just two weeks away, and we've already seen Trae Young change addresses, with Ja Morant and Anthony Davis rumored to follow suit. But instead of regurgitating those same two names, I'm wondering if we should identify teams that are just generally in need of doing … well, something!Detroit is No. 1 in the East, and that's obviously good, but I can't escape the feeling they aren't that heavy in the talent department. [Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Tobias Harris’ expiring contract, worth over $26.6 million, could be a big trade chip, and now is the time to do something as Jalen Duren is going to earn a new paycheck this coming summer. Lauri Markkanen is a name often bandied about in connection with the Pistons, but should they even try to enter into negotiations with Danny Ainge? Kelly Iko: The Pistons are having a historic season, are loaded with young talent and have the league’s second-ranked defense. It would be an absolute buzzkill for them to stand pat before the trade deadline. From an offensive standpoint, Detroit is kind of meh. They’re 26th in offensive rating since Jan. 1, 23rd in halfcourt points per possession, 26th in 3-point attempt rate and 22nd in 3-point makes. In a perfect world, Cade Cunningham would be this prolific driver, drawing downhill gravity and spraying out to shooters on the perimeter who could either knock down catch-and-shoot looks or create their own if the defense adjusts. According to Second Spectrum, Cunningham is fifth in drives per game (16.8), but the difference between him and, say, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, is stark. Cunningham shoots 10% worse on drives and 10% worse at the free-throw line than SGA.The playoffs are essentially a math problem and when the book is out on Detroit — swarm Cunningham at the point of attack and dare their role players to make shots — the issues could come quickly. Houston’s 2024-25 season comes to mind: exciting young core with a kick-ass defense that struggles in the halfcourt. That was a first-round exit. So yes, I think Markkanen makes sense in a lot of ways as a jumbo creator with uber-spacing ability. Ditto for Michael Porter Jr. and Trey Murphy. Yahoo Sports’ Kevin O’Connor recently put together a nice list of names the Pistons should be chasing, but the overarching theme is as awesome as Detroit has been for a refreshing storyline, this is anything but a perfect team. Back to you, Mort. Who’s second on your list and why? Perhaps a team out West …Mort: Sir, if you're insinuating that I should bring up the Spurs here, I shan't disappoint. This team is just so far ahead of where most had them pegged at this stage, and that leads to a similar conclusion as you had with Detroit. It'd be a buzzkill if they didn't do, well, something.So let me throw something your way that's proper insanity. The Spurs need a more-than-solid wing big if they are to constantly go up against the Oklahoma City Thunder. We can sit here all day and talk about short-term solutions and who might come cheaper on the trade front, but let's kill that noise and go all in. Deni Avdija. The Blazers have zero — and I mean ZERO — interest in moving off their 26/7/7 wing, who should make his first All-Star team this season.As such, the Spurs need to make what we rarely see anymore: the Godfather offer. Kelly Olynyk for salary-matching and damn near every tradable pick under the sun, in particular the juicy ones, such as Atlanta's 2027, a future Kings swap option and some of their own in the 2030s.They're clearly moving off Jeremy Sochan, and while Harrison Barnes is one of the best role players in the league, he's getting up there in age. There's going to be a need for a wing big who can play power forward, and they need someone who can shoot, handle the ball and initiate plays in such a role. Why not make a play for a guy who fits the timeline, is dirt cheap ($13.1 million in 2026-2027 and $11.8 million in 2027-28) and could realistically catapult you into championship contention this very season? At the very least, the Blazers can receive the offer. If they wish to stick with Avdija, which I think we both could understand, then so be it. But it'd show some aggressiveness on behalf of the Spurs in trying to fulfill their mission as soon as possible and while Victor Wembanyama is still young and (relatively) healthy. (I don't want to put the injury hex on him, but let's be real. Human beings who are 7-feet-5 and play professional sports historically play fewer years than, say, smaller lead guards.)Iko: Love the idea of Avdija in San Antonio. So much of what the Spurs do — from a non-Wemby and offensive balance vantage point — revolves around the proficiency of their guard play. Bringing in a taller initiator with legit three-level scoring ability would give them an added wrinkle while still keeping their spacing in Devin Vassell and Julian Champagnie. Here’s my devil’s advocate question for you, though. We just named two teams that could benefit from pulling the trade trigger. But what about the teams that would be letting these assets go? Is there a world where the Blazers ponder what Avdija looks like next to a healthy Damian Lillard? Is there a world where the Jazz start to actually build around Markkanen and Keyonte George? Or are those teams destined for NBA purgatory and should flip their hot commodities while they still can? Mort: I usually want teams in NBA purgatory to not go all in, as that often insinuates they don't have their leading man. (Neither the Blazers nor Jazz are in purgatory due to their situations, but it's fair to wonder if their ultimate ceiling is capped as none of Avdija, Markkanen or George projects as a Tier 1 superstar.) However. Allow me to just bring up the Bulls for a second. We don't assume competence on their part, and probably rightly so, but have you seen the situation they're in? If new leadership were to take over, it'd be licking its chops: an enormous bundle of expiring contracts, upward of $80-plus million, control of all of their picks and even some youngsters with trade value. Is this a team that should take a step back and build even more draft equity? Probably, but that's never been its favorite song. Instead, this leadership has a history of buying and leaning into some questionable upgrades, such as Nikola Vučević at the trade deadline in 2021, when they then followed up in free agency by acquiring both Lonzo Ball and DeMar DeRozan. Is this on-the-fence team one we should keep an eye on? Generally speaking, I'm curious how teams with numerous trade assets will decide to act before Feb. 5. Do they see this as a means of buying low on, say, Zion Williamson or Ja Morant? Williamson is reportedly off the table in trade negotiations, but excuse my French when I say, “Baloney!” Personally, I don't think it's a smart strategy, but reasonable people can disagree, and we must at least acknowledge there is star quality attached to both names. Iko: Ironically, we talked about Chicago prior to the season. These sneaky Bulls always mosey their way into the conversation.I’m generally wary of anything going on in the Windy City (DJ Moore routes included), but if I’m in the Bulls’ front office and I’m pondering whether to make a move for Morant or Williamson, why not just go for both? It sounds ludicrous until you actually give it some thought. Health and availability is obviously the biggest factor in moving for either of these players, but they’re still young enough (Zion, 25; Morant, 26) where you could sell a core along with rookie Matas Buzelis, who’s been a bright spot and showcased some underrated defensive versatility. Again, this only works if you can guarantee that both play in at least 65 games (big if), but I’m tired of the Bulls being boring. Shoot for the oft-injured stars. On a more serious note, I appreciate how each team approaches this time of the year. The rumor mill can get a bit mundane, but at least if you sift through enough, you’ll get an understanding of individual organizational goals and objectives. It should be a fun two weeks.",

    "content_html": "Every team in the Eastern Conference has played at least 41 games, which means we have reached the NBA regular season’s midway point, which means it is high time for a report card. (Our midseason awards can be found here.)The Detroit Pistons (31-10), led on offense by Cade Cunningham and owners of the East’s best defense, are running away with the No. 1 seed, holding on to a 5.5-game lead in the conference.Still, the East is as wide open as it has ever been. The second-place and surprising Boston Celtics (26-16) could return Jayson Tatum for the fourth quarter of this season. The New York Knicks (25-18) have been floundering, but we know what they are capable of when they are firing on all cylinders. Same goes for the sloooowly-getting-better Cleveland Cavaliers (24-20).[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Meanwhile, the Philadelphia 76ers (23-19) and Orlando Magic (23-19) are lurking, if only they could stay healthy. Then there are the Toronto Raptors (26-19), who are as plucky as anybody.We have yet to see a team in the East that has made the statement: We are prepared to battle whomever emerges from the Western Conference in the NBA Finals. Maybe Detroit is THEM. The Pistons could use one more impact player, but that is for the trade deadline to determine.Now, though, it is time to get to the grades …Atlanta Hawks • Boston Celtics • Brooklyn Nets • Charlotte Hornets • Chicago Bulls • Cleveland Cavaliers • Detroit Pistons • Indiana Pacers • Miami Heat • Milwaukee Bucks • New York Knicks • Orlando Magic • Philadelphia 76ers • Toronto Raptors • Washington Wizards(Our first-quarter grades can be found here.)(Mallory Bielecki/Yahoo Sports Illustration)Atlanta Hawks (20-25)Midseason MVP: Jalen Johnson (23-10-8 on 51/36/78)Offensive rating: 113.4 (22nd) • Defensive rating: 114.8 (16th)Best lineup: Johnson • Nickeil Alexander-Walker • Dyson Daniels • Zaccharie Risacher • Kristaps Porziņģis (+19 in 129 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 11-18 • Against losing teams: 9-7Comments: Since trading Trae Young, the Hawks are 3-4, hardly the start they anticipated upon dealing the four-time All-Star point guard. … On the whole, they have been outscored by 1.4 points per 100 meaningful possessions when Young is not on the court, per Cleaning the Glass. … Atlanta was supposed to be a darkhorse candidate to emerge from the East. Instead, it looks like it could be bound for the play-in again. … Is another big move in development?Grade: DBoston Celtics (26-16)Midseason MVP: Jaylen Brown (30-7-5 on 49/36/79)Offensive rating: 121.4 (2nd) • Defensive rating: 114.0 (14th)Best lineup: Brown • Payton Pritchard • Derrick White • Sam Hauser • Neemias Queta (+53 in 134 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 13-12 • Against losing teams: 13-4Comments: The Celtics own the East’s second-best record and its second-best net rating, all in the absence of an injured Jayson Tatum. … Tatum’s return could be sooner than later. … Jaylen Brown has played his way into the MVP conversation. … Anfernee Simons and Sam Hauser have also played well enough for the Celtics to consider a) not moving either at the deadline or b) packaging one or both of them, along with picks, for a significant upgrade. … They could use another big.Grade: ABrooklyn Nets (12-29)Midseason MVP: Michael Porter Jr. (26-7-3 on 49/40/85)Offensive rating: 112.3 (25th) • Defensive rating: 117.4 (26th)Best lineup: Porter • Egor Demin • Tre Mann • Noah Clowney • Nicolas Claxton (+18 in 306 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 5-18 • Against losing teams: 7-11Comments: The Nets may have won their trade of Cam Johnson, given how well Michael Porter Jr. has played to this point and the fact that they received an additional first-round pick in the deal. … Porter might fetch more first-round assets if he is shopped by the deadline. … The Nets needed one of their five first-round picks to pop, and none of them have, though Egor Demin has played better of late (14-3-3 on 45/45/83 shooting splits in his last 14 appearances).Grade: CCharlotte Hornets (16-27)Midseason MVP: Kon Knueppel (19-5-4 on 49/44/89)Offensive rating: 116.9 (7th) • Defensive rating: 116.7 (21st)Best lineup: Knueppel • LaMelo Ball • Brandon Miller • Miles Bridges • Moussa Diabate (+63 in 112 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 7-16 • Against losing teams: 9-11Comments: Rookie wing Kon Knueppel, it seems, was a true find at the No. 4 draft slot. … Brandon Miller should be good, too. Together they are a decent foundation. … Is LaMelo Ball a part of that same foundation? He is reportedly open to a trade away from Charlotte, and it might be in the Hornets’ best interest to deal him. … They have not won with him. … Then again, they are +11.5 points per 100 meaningful possessions when Knueppel, Miller and Ball share a court.Grade: DChicago Bulls (21-22)Midseason MVP: Josh Giddey (19-9-9 on 47/39/76)Offensive rating: 114.4 (16th) • Defensive rating: 116.8 (23rd)Best lineup: Giddey • Matas Buzelis • Kevin Huerter • Isaac Okoro • Nikola Vučević (+5 in 65 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 10-11 • Against losing teams: 11-11Comments: Shocker of all shockers: The Bulls are hovering around .500 again, bound for another play-in tournament in a watered-down Eastern Conference, no chance at winning. … Lots to like about Matas Buzelis. … You can’t help but appreciate Nikola Vučević’s efforts, too, even as he seems endlessly frustrated by Chicago’s perpetual quest for mediocrity. … What to do with Coby White, a 2026 free agent? … The Bulls are full of questions, empty of answers. Grade: DCleveland Cavaliers (24-20)Midseason MVP: Donovan Mitchell (29-5-6 on 49/38/84)Offensive rating: 116.5 (10th) • Defensive rating: 114.6 (15th)Best lineup: Mitchell • Darius Garland • De’Andre Hunter • Evan Mobley • Jarrett Allen (+29 in 51 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 10-15 • Against losing teams: 14-5Comments: That redundancy of Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland in the backcourt and Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen in the frontcourt? Still a problem. … Far more of a problem than it was a year ago at this time, when the Cavs were bound for a 64-win campaign. … Then again, when all four are on the court, Cleveland is still +7.2 points per 100 meaningful possessions. … Maybe they need a wing. … Maybe they just need Garland healthy. … They need something.Grade: CDetroit Pistons (31-10)Midseason MVP: Cade Cunningham (26-6-10 on 45/33/82)Offensive rating: 116.0 (11th) • Defensive rating: 108.5 (2nd)Best lineup: Cunningham • Ausar Thompson • Duncan Robinson • Tobias Harris • Jalen Duren (+57 in 276 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 14-4 • Against losing teams: 17-6Comments: The Pistons own the East’s best record and best net rating. How could we complain? … Cade Cunningham has been everything Detroit could have asked for from its No. 1 pick. … Jalen Duren should be an All-Star. … They need to upgrade the Tobias Harris position if they want to seriously compete with the West. … Lauri Markkanen would be nice, but his cost is prohibitive. … Michael Porter Jr.? Now, he would establish them as clear favorites in the East.Grade: AIndiana Pacers (10-34)Midseason MVP: Pascal Siakam (24-7-4 on 48/38/68)Offensive rating: 107.9 (30th) • Defensive rating: 116.0 (19th)Best lineup: Siakam • Andrew Nembhard • Ben Sheppard • Bennedict Mathurin • Jay Huff (+9 in 39 minutes)Against .500+ teams: 3-25 • Against losing teams: 7-9Comments: Look at what the Celtics have done without Tatum, and look at what the Pacers have done without Tyrese Haliburton. … It’s not the worst-case scenario. Indiana has quickly pivoted to becoming a tanking team, once it became clear it had no chance of seriously competing for a playoff spot. … In that sense, they are a success, falling to the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, in line for a top-four overall pick.

After leaving Tuesday's contest due to an eye poke, Ayton posted a photo on Instagram in which he's wearing a patch over his eye.On the photo, Ayton added a pirate emoji, poking fun at his appearance.From Deandre’s IG: https://t.co/BVi0xIjnXgpic.twitter.com/fnXvfYnQon— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) January 21, 2026He was far from the only member of the Lakers to make that comparison. After the contest, Lakers head coach JJ Redick said Ayton looked \"like a pirate\" after leaving the contest just before halftime. Ayton did not play the entire third quarter due to the injury. Before the fourth quarter was over, the Lakers announced he would miss the rest of the contest. He finished with four points and eight rebounds in roughly 15 minutes during the Lakers' 115-107 win over the Denver Nuggets.While Redick said Ayton's eye was \"not in good shape\" after the game, the team doesn't expect Ayton to miss time. Redick added that the center \"will be fine\" ahead of Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers. Even if Ayton needs to miss that game, it doesn't sound like the eye injury will keep him sidelined for long. After spending the last two seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, Ayton joined the Lakers on a two-year deal in the offseason. He's put up his usual numbers through 37 games with the team, averaging 13.9 points and 8.8 rebounds.",

    "description": "Golden State&#39;s best-laid plans have gone up in smoke. Is it finally time for a hard reset?",
    "content_html": "Adding Jimmy Butler fundamentally changed who the Warriors were last season — the way they played, the heights they could aspire to, their chances of playing meaningful basketball deep into springtime once again. Losing Butler on Monday to a torn right ACL — a devastating blow that sapped every ounce of sweetness out of Golden State’s fourth consecutive double-digit win — fundamentally changes who the Warriors are this season, and threatens a devastating alteration to who they could conceivably still be in the “fading dynasty” stage of the Stephen Curry/Draymond Green/Steve Kerr era.Let’s start with the obvious: It is extremely, extremely damaging to lose a player as good as Butler, whose teams have either outright won or been demonstrably better in his minutes in every season save the one where he was trying to force his way out of Minnesota.Even at age 36, a crisp 15 years and nearly 35,000 NBA minutes into his career, Butler remains one of the league’s best all-around players — a high-efficiency, low-mistake offensive connector; a versatile and disruptive defender; a high-IQ adaptor able to fit neatly into the flow when playing alongside Curry and scale up into a larger, more central role when Steph’s off the floor; a consistently high-floor contributor with few peers at his position.(Grant Thomas/Yahoo Sports illutration)Butler is second on the Warriors in scoring, third in assists and rebounds, and leads them in steals and total minutes played. There are four players in the NBA this season averaging at least 20 points, five rebounds, four assists and a steal per game while making at least half of their shots: Butler, perennial MVP favorite Nikola Jokić, and ascendant All-Star-caliber bigs Alperen Şengün and Jalen Johnson.The advanced stats, as ever, love him: He’s been a top-15-to-20 player this season in the eyes of estimated plus-minus, LEBRON, DARKO, value over replacement player, player efficiency rating, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus-minus and regularized adjusted plus-minus, among other metrics. The Warriors have been 9.6 points per 100 possessions better with Butler on the court than off it this season, according to Cleaning the Glass; among players who’ve logged 1,000 minutes, that’s the 10th-largest on/off swing in the NBA.Butler had averaged just under 22-5-5 on pristine .649 true shooting over the past month prior to exiting early against Miami. He was playing some of the best ball of his career, and with it, the Warriors had started to stabilize: Golden State has won four straight and 12 of its last 16, with the NBA’s second-best record and fifth-best net rating in that span.During that period, the Warriors have outscored opponents by 8.4 points per 100 possessions with Butler on the floor, compared to a plus-4.4 net rating without him. That includes a mammoth plus-12.9 net rating in the 183 minutes that Butler played without Curry, continuing the trend that began last season of Golden State finally being able to not only survive non-Steph minutes, but sometimes actually build a lead while he rested. (Imagine that.)Only one Warriors five-man lineup without Butler in it has played more than 20 minutes together this season; the quintet of Curry, Green, Gary Payton II, Brandin Podziemski and Moses Moody has been outscored by 13 points. That, um, will need to change — as will the general tenor of the non-Steph minutes, which, with Butler lost for the season, threaten to return to disaster time. The Warriors have been outscored by 3.9 points-per-100 this season with neither Curry nor Butler on the floor, posting a dismal non-garbage-time offensive rating of just 105.2 — several sub-basements below what the league-worst attack of the Tyrese Haliburton-less 10-34 Pacers has mustered over the course of this season.Combine that with the degree to which Golden State had struggled to tread water in non-Jimmy minutes even with Steph on the floor — just plus-1.1 points-per-100 over nearly 500 minutes this season — and the Warriors have a pretty gnarly puzzle to solve over the second half of the season if they hope to have any chance of remaining in postseason position.After Tuesday’s loss to the Toronto Raptors, Golden State sits at 25-20, in eighth place in the Western Conference — in line for their third straight trip to the play-in tournament. With Butler in the fold and playing at an All-Star level, Kerr, general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Co. could reasonably harbor hopes of erasing the two-game gap between them and the fifth-place Houston Rockets, putting themselves in position to not only avoid the play-in but potentially challenge for home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs. Now, though, the Warriors braintrust has to consider whether it’s likelier that they rise or fall — they’re three games ahead of ninth-place Portland, five games up on the 10th-place Clippers, and 5.5 clear of 11th-place Memphis — and how their internal projections will inform their decision-making ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline.Five days past the NBA’s most closely watched trade eligibility date, Jonathan Kuminga remains a member of the Warriors. Twenty-four hours ago, it seemed likely that Dunleavy would keep beating the bushes in search of a deal that could turn the out-of-favor 23-year-old into something, anything, that could improve the Warriors’ chances of making a deep playoff run. But with Golden State now in desperate need of a wing-sized person capable of putting the ball in the basket, even if it’s not in precisely the way Kerr prefers, and with the most frequently stated reason for shelving Kuminga — effectively, we can’t play three not-really-shooters who need the ball in their hands, and Jimmy and Draymond are better than Kuminga is — now a moot point, does that calculus change?If and when Kerr turns back to Kuminga — which he did at least on Tuesday — how might the fifth-year forward respond? It seems like an awful lot, asking someone who has essentially been out of the rotation for two months to suddenly start replicating the production of a top-20 player — especially considering lineups where he’s had to carry the offensive workload without Steph or Jimmy have gotten drilled over the past two seasons. If a reintroduced Kuminga struggles under these adverse conditions, does it become even more difficult to move him for a return of noteworthy value? And if he doesn’t — if he looks great — well, then what do you do with a guy you’ve signaled in every way possible that you’re ready to drive to the airport at the earliest opportunity, but who’s suddenly become a load-bearing column in your current build?The $11 billion question hanging over all of this, in the hours after Butler’s grim diagnosis: Just what is that “current build,” now?The premise behind the Butler trade and subsequent extension was clean, clear and evident to all who observed it. Golden State had lined up the contracts of Curry, Butler and Green to take aim at a title run in 2024-25 and 2025-26, with a possible third in 2026-27, when Green holds a $27.7 million player option. It was an unmistakable declaration of intent: As long as we have Steph playing LIKE THIS, we’re going to go for it.And it worked, and it looked great … until it didn’t. The first run ended in the second round, after Steph hurt his hamstring against the Timberwolves; with Butler’s season now over, the second one appears to have ended before it could even get started. And now, the Warriors find themselves back where they were this time last year: with Curry still playing like this, but without a supporting cast commensurate with the frankly unbelievable level at which he continues to produce.Maybe that gives the rest of Golden State’s roster short shrift. De’Anthony Melton is finally healthy again and playing great. Al Horford’s starting to show signs of coming around. Podziemski’s in the midst of his best run of play of the season. Moody and Buddy Hield are shooting better than 40% from 3-point land over the last month. Maybe they keep rolling, and Kerr’s able to find enough contributions from elsewhere — from rookie Will Richard, from Quinten Post, from Trayce Jackson-Davis, and on, and on — to keep the Warriors in the fight, where they’re forever one Curry flurry from delivering a knockout blow.And maybe the injury doesn’t necessarily preclude one last big comeback run. The average return-to-play following an ACL tear is about 11 months, according to Jeff Stotts of In Street Clothes; that would put Butler’s return somewhere around Christmas, meaning he’d miss roughly the first quarter of the 2026-27 season, giving Golden State a lot of runway to get up to full strength before mid-April. Maybe there are still two real bites at the apple here.Maybe, though, Butler’s injury shakes the Warriors’ faith in the viability of that timeline — in the likelihood that, 14 months from now, a core of a 39-year-old Curry, a 37-year-old Green and a 37-year-old, post-ACL-reconstruction Butler will be good enough to win in the playoffs. If Dunleavy and Co. arrive at that conclusion, they’ll have to decide whether they’re comfortable continuing to ride what they’ve got into the sunset — appreciating that time comes for us all, that best-laid plans sometimes go awry, and that it’s worth allowing the Steph-Draymond-Jimmy core to run its course — or if it’s time to make even more drastic changes to the roster, in service of seeding the ground for the next era of Warriors basketball, whenever that might start.The former path would be perfectly respectable, if not downright honorable. In a world that’s seen the Warriors try to pull off the two timelines plan and let Klay Thompson walk, though, the latter can’t be ruled out. I don’t think that means they’re going to trade Steph in the middle of the night. (Although, y’know: Luka.) I do think, though, it means that just about anything else could be on the table, one fundamental change begetting another.",

    "description": "Jeanie Buss reportedly soured on LeBron James after the Russell Westbrook trade.",
    "content_html": "The Los Angeles Lakers returned to notoriety when the team signed superstar LeBron James in free agency ahead of the 2018-19 NBA season. While that partnership turned out well initially — with James leading the team to a championship in his second season — Lakers owner Jeanie Buss reportedly began to sour on James, per ESPN's Baxter Holmes. That tidbit was revealed as part of a much larger piece on the Buss' family drama and how it led to the team being sold to Mark Walter. While there are plenty of juicy revelations in the article, Buss' relationship with James will likely draw the most attention.Buss' opinion of James reportedly started to change after the Lakers traded for Russell Westbrook in 2021. The move, which the team made to make James happy, backfired. Westbook's fit on the Lakers was awkward, and the team failed to make the playoffs after acquiring the veteran. Buss reportedly was frustrated with the way James washed his hands of the deal and blamed others after it failed, per ESPN.Buss reportedly even considered trading James at one point — with the Los Angeles Clippers being the most likely destination. That didn't happen, and James inserted a no-trade clause into his 2024 extension, making a deal impossible now unless James approves it. The relationship further soured after the Lakers drafted James' son, Bronny, in the second round of the 2024 NBA Draft. Buss reportedly felt LeBron should have been more grateful the team picked his son in the draft, per ESPN.\"And when the Lakers drafted James' son, Bronny, with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn't, people close to the team told ESPN.\"Bronny, 21, has been used in a reserve role in the NBA. He's averaged 1.9 points in 51 career games. If those reports are true, Buss and James could be heading for a clean break in the offseason. James' contract is up at the end of the season, allowing the 41-year-old to easily leave the team in the offseason. James has still performed well this season and has helped the Lakers to a 26-16 start. If he wants to keep playing, James could almost certainly find a job with another franchise.But it's unclear whether James will do that. The 23-year veteran has not addressed his future in the NBA past the 2025-26 season. If James does come back for one more year, it's possible he once again considers the Lakers. But if Wednesday's report is accurate, James' return to Los Angeles could be dependent on whether Buss, who remains the team's governor and minority owner, can still co-exist with the superstar.",

    "content_html": "Los Angeles Lakers big man Deandre Ayton is temporarily adopting a new look. After leaving Tuesday's contest due to an eye poke, Ayton posted a photo on Instagram in which he's wearing a patch over his eye.On the photo, Ayton added a pirate emoji, poking fun at his appearance.From Deandre’s IG: https://t.co/BVi0xIjnXgpic.twitter.com/fnXvfYnQon— Dave McMenamin (@mcten) January 21, 2026He was far from the only member of the Lakers to make that comparison. After the contest, Lakers head coach JJ Redick said Ayton looked \"like a pirate\" after leaving the contest just before halftime. Ayton did not play the entire third quarter due to the injury. Before the fourth quarter was over, the Lakers announced he would miss the rest of the contest. He finished with four points and eight rebounds in roughly 15 minutes during the Lakers' 115-107 win over the Denver Nuggets.While Redick said Ayton's eye was \"not in good shape\" after the game, the team doesn't expect Ayton to miss time. Redick added that the center \"will be fine\" ahead of Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers. Even if Ayton needs to miss that game, it doesn't sound like the eye injury will keep him sidelined for long. After spending the last two seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, Ayton joined the Lakers on a two-year deal in the offseason. He's put up his usual numbers through 37 games with the team, averaging 13.9 points and 8.8 rebounds.",

    "description": "Golden State&#39;s best-laid plans have gone up in smoke. Is it finally time for a hard reset?",
    "content_html": "Adding Jimmy Butler fundamentally changed who the Warriors were last season — the way they played, the heights they could aspire to, their chances of playing meaningful basketball deep into springtime once again. Losing Butler on Monday to a torn right ACL — a devastating blow that sapped every ounce of sweetness out of Golden State’s fourth consecutive double-digit win — fundamentally changes who the Warriors are this season, and threatens a devastating alteration to who they could conceivably still be in the “fading dynasty” stage of the Stephen Curry/Draymond Green/Steve Kerr era.Let’s start with the obvious: It is extremely, extremely damaging to lose a player as good as Butler, whose teams have either outright won or been demonstrably better in his minutes in every season save the one where he was trying to force his way out of Minnesota.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Even at age 36, a crisp 15 years and nearly 35,000 NBA minutes into his career, Butler remains one of the league’s best all-around players — a high-efficiency, low-mistake offensive connector; a versatile and disruptive defender; a high-IQ adaptor able to fit neatly into the flow when playing alongside Curry and scale up into a larger, more central role when Steph’s off the floor; a consistently high-floor contributor with few peers at his position.(Grant Thomas/Yahoo Sports illutration)Butler is second on the Warriors in scoring, third in assists and rebounds, and leads them in steals and total minutes played. There are four players in the NBA this season averaging at least 20 points, five rebounds, four assists and a steal per game while making at least half of their shots: Butler, perennial MVP favorite Nikola Jokić, and ascendant All-Star-caliber bigs Alperen Şengün and Jalen Johnson.The advanced stats, as ever, love him: He’s been a top-15-to-20 player this season in the eyes of estimated plus-minus, LEBRON, DARKO, value over replacement player, player efficiency rating, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus-minus and regularized adjusted plus-minus, among other metrics. The Warriors have been 9.6 points per 100 possessions better with Butler on the court than off it this season, according to Cleaning the Glass; among players who’ve logged 1,000 minutes, that’s the 10th-largest on/off swing in the NBA.Butler had averaged just under 22-5-5 on pristine .649 true shooting over the past month prior to exiting early against Miami. He was playing some of the best ball of his career, and with it, the Warriors had started to stabilize: Golden State has won four straight and 12 of its last 16, with the NBA’s second-best record and fifth-best net rating in that span.During that period, the Warriors have outscored opponents by 8.4 points per 100 possessions with Butler on the floor, compared to a plus-4.4 net rating without him. That includes a mammoth plus-12.9 net rating in the 183 minutes that Butler played without Curry, continuing the trend that began last season of Golden State finally being able to not only survive non-Steph minutes, but sometimes actually build a lead while he rested. (Imagine that.)Only one Warriors five-man lineup without Butler in it has played more than 20 minutes together this season; the quintet of Curry, Green, Gary Payton II, Brandin Podziemski and Moses Moody has been outscored by 13 points. That, um, will need to change — as will the general tenor of the non-Steph minutes, which, with Butler lost for the season, threaten to return to disaster time. The Warriors have been outscored by 3.9 points-per-100 this season with neither Curry nor Butler on the floor, posting a dismal non-garbage-time offensive rating of just 105.2 — several sub-basements below what the league-worst attack of the Tyrese Haliburton-less 10-34 Pacers has mustered over the course of this season.Combine that with the degree to which Golden State had struggled to tread water in non-Jimmy minutes even with Steph on the floor — just plus-1.1 points-per-100 over nearly 500 minutes this season — and the Warriors have a pretty gnarly puzzle to solve over the second half of the season if they hope to have any chance of remaining in postseason position.Golden State enters Tuesday’s game against the Toronto Raptors at 25-19, in eighth place in the Western Conference — in line for their third straight trip to the play-in tournament. With Butler in the fold and playing at an All-Star level, Kerr, general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Co. could reasonably harbor hopes of erasing the two-game gap between them and the fifth-place Houston Rockets, putting themselves in position to not only avoid the play-in but potentially challenge for home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs. Now, though, the Warriors braintrust has to consider whether it’s likelier that they rise or fall — they’re three games ahead of ninth-place Portland, five games up on the 10th-place Clippers, and 5.5 clear of 11th-place Memphis — and how their internal projections will inform their decision-making ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline.Five days past the NBA’s most closely watched trade eligibility date, Jonathan Kuminga remains a member of the Warriors. Twenty-four hours ago, it seemed likely that Dunleavy would keep beating the bushes in search of a deal that could turn the out-of-favor 23-year-old into something, anything, that could improve the Warriors’ chances of making a deep playoff run. But with Golden State now in desperate need of a wing-sized person capable of putting the ball in the basket, even if it’s not in precisely the way Kerr prefers, and with the most frequently stated reason for shelving Kuminga — effectively, we can’t play three not-really-shooters who need the ball in their hands, and Jimmy and Draymond are better than Kuminga is — now a moot point, does that calculus change?If and when Kerr turns back to Kuminga — which he didn’t on Monday, but which he said could happen in the days and weeks ahead — how might the fifth-year forward respond? It seems like an awful lot, asking someone who has essentially been out of the rotation for two months to suddenly start replicating the production of a top-20 player — especially considering lineups where he’s had to carry the offensive workload without Steph or Jimmy have gotten drilled over the past two seasons. If a reintroduced Kuminga struggles under these adverse conditions, does it become even more difficult to move him for a return of noteworthy value? And if he doesn’t — if he looks great — well, then what do you do with a guy you’ve signaled in every way possible that you’re ready to drive to the airport at the earliest opportunity, but who’s suddenly become a load-bearing column in your current build?The $11 billion question hanging over all of this, in the hours after Butler’s grim diagnosis: Just what is that “current build,” now?The premise behind the Butler trade and subsequent extension was clean, clear and evident to all who observed it. Golden State had lined up the contracts of Curry, Butler and Green to take aim at a title run in 2024-25 and 2025-26, with a possible third in 2026-27, when Green holds a $27.7 million player option. It was an unmistakable declaration of intent: As long as we have Steph playing LIKE THIS, we’re going to go for it.And it worked, and it looked great … until it didn’t. The first run ended in the second round, after Steph hurt his hamstring against the Timberwolves; with Butler’s season now over, the second one appears to have ended before it could even get started. And now, the Warriors find themselves back where they were this time last year: with Curry still playing like this, but without a supporting cast commensurate with the frankly unbelievable level at which he continues to produce.Maybe that gives the rest of Golden State’s roster short shrift. De’Anthony Melton is finally healthy again and playing great. Al Horford’s starting to show signs of coming around. Podziemski’s in the midst of his best run of play of the season. Moody and Buddy Hield are shooting better than 40% from 3-point land over the last month. Maybe they keep rolling, and Kerr’s able to find enough contributions from elsewhere — from rookie Will Richard, from Quinten Post, from Trayce Jackson-Davis, and on, and on — to keep the Warriors in the fight, where they’re forever one Curry flurry from delivering a knockout blow.And maybe the injury doesn’t necessarily preclude one last big comeback run. The average return-to-play following an ACL tear is about 11 months, according to Jeff Stotts of In Street Clothes; that would put Butler’s return somewhere around Christmas, meaning he’d miss roughly the first quarter of the 2026-27 season, giving Golden State a lot of runway to get up to full strength before mid-April. Maybe there are still two real bites at the apple here.Maybe, though, Butler’s injury shakes the Warriors’ faith in the viability of that timeline — in the likelihood that, 14 months from now, a core of a 39-year-old Curry, a 37-year-old Green and a 37-year-old, post-ACL-reconstruction Butler will be good enough to win in the playoffs. If Dunleavy and Co. arrive at that conclusion, they’ll have to decide whether they’re comfortable continuing to ride what they’ve got into the sunset — appreciating that time comes for us all, that best-laid plans sometimes go awry, and that it’s worth allowing the Steph-Draymond-Jimmy core to run its course — or if it’s time to make even more drastic changes to the roster, in service of seeding the ground for the next era of Warriors basketball, whenever that might start.The former path would be perfectly respectable, if not downright honorable. In a world that’s seen the Warriors try to pull off the two timelines plan and let Klay Thompson walk, though, the latter can’t be ruled out. I don’t think that means they’re going to trade Steph in the middle of the night. (Although, y’know: Luka.) I do think, though, it means that just about anything else could be on the table, one fundamental change begetting another.",

    "description": "With the NBA trade deadline two weeks away, let&#39;s sort through the players who have reportedly been in trade talks.",
    "content_html": "Welcome back to the world’s most accurate power rankings, where this week, before the Feb. 5 trade deadline, we are adding a wrinkle, rating 25 “available” NBA players from worst to first.Just how “available” they are is in some question. Giannis Antetokounmpo, for example, may want out, but until he formally requests a trade, the Milwaukee Bucks will be hesitant to grant him one. Others are readily available. Some may only be parted with for the right asking price.But all of them make some sense as trade candidates, given their situations. So, here we are to sort them based upon their talent, their contracts, their fits, their everything. Mostly: Can any of them meaningfully change a team’s championship chances? Here we try to sort them in order, mostly, based on how much each could alter this year’s title picture. Surely you will not argue.(Taylor Wilhelm/Yahoo Sports Illustration)One more thing before we get to the rankings: Karl-Anthony Towns. Is he available? Whispers are growing louder, if only because his New York Knicks are struggling. But I still cannot imagine a world in which the Knicks disrupt their roster — one that remains a favorite to emerge from the East — for anyone but Antetokounmpo. So we will leave him sidelined for now.Honorable mentions: Cam Thomas, Brooklyn Nets; Chris Paul, Los Angeles Clippers; De’Andre Hunter, Cleveland Cavaliers; Malik Monk; Sacramento Kings.25. Jonathan Kuminga, Golden State WarriorsOn Thursday, Kuminga demanded a trade from the Warriors. On Friday, we discussed whether he was even a good basketball player. On Monday, Golden State’s Jimmy Butler tore his right ACL, leaving open a massive hole on the wing. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was asked if he will turn to Kuminga, and in a disheartened voice he said, “Sure. Absolutely.” Audition time, I guess?24. Immanuel Quickley, Toronto RaptorsThe Raptors have canvassed the market, shopping “some of their players, including RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley,” looking to see what value they might find, according to ESPN. Among their reported potential targets are Anthony Davis and Ja Morant. Why a trade partner would want the three years and $97.5 million left on Quickley’s deal is a question to which it would need answers.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]23. Kristaps Porziņģis, Atlanta HawksThe Hawks, along with the Raptors, are reportedly among the teams that remain interested in the services of Davis, even after a hand injury that could sideline him through the All-Star break. Any Hawks trade for a high-priced star would have to include the $30.7 million expiring contract for Porziņģis, whose health remains a concern. Get him on the court, though, and he would help.22. Anfernee Simons, Boston CelticsOver the summer, Boston was “still very much willing to talk about Simons” in trade discussions, per longtime Celtics insider Steve Bulpett, even after acquiring the former Blazers guard in July. It makes sense, given Simons’ expiring $27.7 million salary. Boston has two reasons to shop him: 1) to duck the luxury tax or 2) to roll that salary forward for a surprisingly competitive roster. 21. Nikola Vučević, Chicago BullsBecause Vučević is on an expiring $21.5 million salary, longtime trade speculation has only rampedup this season, and Vučević himself might even want a change in scenery. To that end, Bulls coach Billy Donovan said, “I do think he’s invested and committed.” Which may make him even more tradable. The Bulls hold enough expiring money to pursue Davis, a local product.20. Jalen Green, Phoenix SunsWhile Green has not been mentioned in any well-sourced trade rumors, the Suns would almost certainly have to include his $33.6 million salary in any discussion of upgrades to a team fighting for a guaranteed playoff seed in the West. The former No. 2 overall pick has shown flashes as a 20-point scorer, though his defense and an ongoing hamstring injury are reasons for concern. 19. Herb Jones, New Orleans PelicansHerb Jones and Trey Murphy III are among the names the Pelicans are not willing to discuss ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline, per Chris Haynes. But teams will continue to call, so long as New Orleans remains at the bottom of the standings. Jones, a 3-and-D wing who has shot 32% from distance over the past two seasons, signed a three-year, $67.6 million extension in July. 18. DeMar DeRozan, Sacramento KingsThe NBA’s worst-keptsecret: Everyone on the Kings, including Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, are available in a trade, particularly as Sacramento pursues another headliner. The Kings could even be open to a DeRozan-for-Morant swap, so long as it does not cost them much more than Devin Carter, but is that enough to persuade Memphis?17. Zach LaVine, Sacramento KingsAs with DeRozan, there is no secret about LaVine’s availability via trade. He is owed $49 million next season, when he will turn 32 years old. He has played four playoff games in 12 years. He has always been an efficient 20-point scorer, even if he cannot defend well and commits almost as many turnovers as he registers assists. It only makes sense that his contract is up for grabs.16. RJ Barrett, Toronto RaptorsLike Quickley, Barrett’s salary — $27.7 million this season and $29.6 million next season — makes for an intriguing match in Toronto’s pursuit of an upgrade, which is another reason why he has been linked to rumors surrounding both Davis and Morant. Barrett holds some value on his own, as the 25-year-old has averaged a fairly efficient 20-5-4 for the fourth-place Raptors.15. Coby White, Chicago BullsRival executives are circling the Bulls, according to ESPN’s Jamal Collier, and they may be more open to trading White’s expiring $12.9 million salary than ever before, per Substack insider Marc Stein. Of course, White is owed a potentially costly contract extension at season’s end. The Wolves are reportedly among the teams weighing whether that juice is worth the squeeze.14. Jarrett Allen, Cleveland CavaliersGiven the mix in Cleveland, with Evan Mobley emerging as a force in the middle, we have long wondered whether Allen would be long for the Cavaliers. Trade consideration subsided last season, as the Cavs won 64 games, but ever since they lost another second-round playoff series and started this season in search of a playoff guarantee, speculation has only resurfaced.13. Tyler Herro, Miami HeatMiami will be linked to whatever superstar becomes available, including if and when the Bucks decide to entertain sweepstakes for Giannis Antetokounmpo. One of the few assets the Heat can offer in return is Herro, a 26-year-old, one-time All-Star and former Sixth Man of the Year. He is owed $33 million in 2026-27. How enticing that is to a team trading a superstar is in question. 12. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets“Ball has grown increasingly frustrated with the organization and is open to a trade away from the franchise,” according to Yahoo Sports’ Kelly Iko. Of course, Ball denied this publicly, saying, “The source wasn’t me, so it’s false info,” though reports ever since have maintained that rival executives are operating under the assumption that Ball is available. Does anyone want him?11. Darius Garland, Cleveland CavaliersAs is the case with Allen in the frontcourt, there is a logjam in Cleveland’s backcourt, where Donovan Mitchell is the premier option. Garland’s impact is somewhat redundant, and the Cavs might be looking to make better sense of their roster. For those interested, though, Substack’s Jake Fischer insists, “I just haven’t heard any credible rumblings about Garland’s availability.”10. Austin Reaves, Los Angeles LakersCredit Lakers superstar LeBron James’ agent, Rich Paul, for entering Reaves’ name into the trade discussion, as he proposed a swap of the Lakers’ 27-year-old guard for Jaren Jackson Jr. Paul is not wrong, either, as Reaves could be owed a near-max contract at season’s end, and any quest for a star partner to James and Luka Dončić would require Reaves’ services in return. 9. Domantas Sabonis, Sacramento KingsAgain: No secret has been made about the availability of Sabonis, LaVine and DeRozan. The Kings are looking to mix things up, once again, and if it costs them their best players, so be it. It is not like Sacramento is winning anything as currently constituted. And Sabonis is capable of a triple-double on any given night, although his defense might dissuade most potential suitors.8. Zion Williamson, New Orleans PelicansWilliamson is among the names the Pelicans have been unwilling to shop, Haynes reported, though he may be the most likely of New Orleans’ targets to be traded, per The Athletic’s William Guillory. The Wizards are reportedly on the list of teams that could be interested at the right price. The right price for the oft-injured forward, though, may not be what the Pels want.7. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies“Everybody in here who knows me, knows I’m a very loyal guy,” insisted Morant. “I got a logo on my back, and that should tell you where I want to be.” Of course, based on everything else we have heard, Morant no longer wants to be on the Grizzlies, and they no longer want him, either. As anticipated, multiple suitors have emerged for Morant, including Miami, though at what cost?6. Trey Murphy III, New Orleans PelicansAnd again: Murphy is among the names New Orleans has been unwilling to discuss. Still, “not completely no on Trey, but a pretty high price tag,” according to The Athletic’s Sam Amick. And it makes complete sense. Murphy (22-6-4 on near 50/40/90 shooting splits) is the exact kind of 3-and-D wing, with the potential for more to his game, that any rival team would want to acquire.5. Michael Porter Jr., Brooklyn NetsIt is unclear how much the Warriors’ reported interest in Porter has changed in the wake of Butler’s injury, as it was even unclear how much Golden State was interested anyhow. Detroit has discussed the idea of dealing for Porter, according to Fischer. We have seen Porter win a title. Surely another contender can convince itself he can help them win, too.4. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesAs the market for Morant unfolds, “there’s a growing thought [among rival executives] that Jackson … could be the next domino to fall at some point,” according to Iko. That thought is widely held about the NBA’s 2023 Defensive Player of the Year. What need would Memphis have for Jackson if the franchise is, as reported, seeking a future-focused package for Morant?3. Anthony Davis, Dallas MavericksDavis’ most recent injury muddied the waters of his trade market, as has every injury he has sustained throughout his career. Atlanta and Toronto both appear to still be interested, but “the cost is most certainly going to be lower than it was even a month ago,” per ESPN’s Shams Charania. Which is why it may be in the best interest of Dallas and Davis to keep the status quo.2. Lauri Markkanen, Utah JazzIt was thought a long shot that Markkanen would remain a member of the Jazz, but Utah exec Austin Ainge insisted the Finnish forward “hopefully is part of our next team when we’re going up.” Keyonte George’s emergence gives Ainge further reason to believe in a come-up, so any trade of Markkanen would surely cost his suitor “an arm and a leg in years of draft capital.” 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee BucksFunny thing about Giannis. He might want out. “I don’t know,” he said most recently, “I take it day by day.” He should want out, since his Bucks are bound for the lottery. But he does not want to ask out, for fear of alienating the fans in Milwaukee, per Collier. So maybe he will let his agent do his bidding. In which case, the league will line up for his services. This is Giannis, after all.",

    "description": "The NBA trade deadline is Feb. 5. The Warriors have a lot to figure out before then.",
    "content_html": "Jimmy Butler's ACL tear is a devastating blow for the veteran All-Star and cause for a reckoning in Golden State over its plans to compete in the back-end of Stephen Curry's prime. General manager Mike Dunleavy was on hand Tuesday night to address the Warriors' short- and long-term plans ahead of Golden State's home game against the Toronto Raptors.He was asked about Butler's future with the franchise as well as that of disgruntled forward Jonathan Kuminga, who's been languishing on the bench amid poor play and a trade demand. And ... let's just say that he has divergent thoughts on Butler's and Kuminga's value on the basketball court.Dunleavy not ready to tear things downWith Butler's injury prompting chatter of a full teardown and the end of the era of competitive basketball with Curry, Dunleavy was asked about the prospect of trading away Butler's contract, which has one year and $56.8 million remaining beyond this season. Dunleavy said that he's not entertaining the idea.  \"I don't envision that,\" Dunleavy said. \"But now that you've brought it up, I guess I'd say what I envision for him is kind of giving us a boost next year the same way he did last year when he arrived. \"And so, at some point during the season, him returning and being the player he's been.\"Mike Dunleavy said he does not envision he will trade Jimmy Butler’s contract and believes Butler will rehab and return to help the team at some point next season pic.twitter.com/FjU1xzDnb6— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) January 21, 2026That sounds like a man not ready to wave the white flag on the Curry era. It's also sounds like the words of an optimist. Butler will be 37 next season and coming off one of the most serious injuries in sports. Can Butler return to high-level basketball after ACL tear?Butler's been a boon for the Warriors and helped spark a run to the second round of the playoffs last season after arriving via a midseason trade. The Warriors made the playoffs as the No. 7 seed out of the play-in, then upset the No. 2 seed Rockets in the first round before falling to the Timberwolves in the second. Butler's arrival was a big reason for that success, and he was playing at an All-Star level this season (20 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 4.9 apg, 1.4 spg) before tearing his right ACL Monday night. If anyone's capable of returning from an ACL tear to play at a high level at 37 years old, Butler's the type of player to do it. And for now, at least, Dunleavy appears to be holding out hope that that's how things play out The alternative is not an appealing option and one that could mean dealing Curry while he still has trade value. They are not ready for that in Golden State. What about Kuminga?As for the short-term, Butler's minutes just opened up, and they need to be filled. That could mean the end of Kuminga's relegation to the bench. Head coach Steve Kerr opened the door to that possibility, telling reporters that Kuminga \"could be\" part of the rotation in Butler's absence. That would require a willingness on both sides to thaw an icy relationship. Dunleavy doesn't sound eager to extend an olive branch. When asked about Kuminga's trade demand, Dunleavy suggested that Kuminga might not drum up much demand for his services.\"As far as the demand, I'm aware of that. In terms of demands, when you make a demand, there needs to be demand — on the market.\"Warriors GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. with a candid quote on Jonathan Kuminga's trade demand. pic.twitter.com/7iNoKxpd2z— KNBR (@KNBR) January 21, 2026\"I think as far as the demand — I'm aware of that,\" Dunleavy said. \"I think in terms of demands, when you make a demand, there needs to be demand on the market. So, we'll see where that unfolds.The NBA trade deadline is Feb. 5. The Warriors have a lot to figure out before then.",

When the trooper pulled over the car, which also changed lanes without signaling, they found Odom and an unidentified male passenger, per KTNV, which reported that both had red, watery eyes and smelled of marijuana.Odom, a former 14-year NBA veteran who's been open about his previous struggles with drug addiction and depression, was arrested and charged with DUI in 2013.On Saturday, when Odom was searching for his registration and insurance, he tried to initiate conversation with the trooper, according 8 News Now, which cited documents it obtained Tuesday. He asked how the trooper's night was going besides him \"driving like he was 'in Back to the Future,'\" the report stated, via 8 News Now.Lamar Odom, flanked here by Derek Fisher and Trevor Ariza at a Los Angeles Lakers at a Christmas Day game in 2023, was arrested in Las Vegas on suspicion of DUI over the weekend. (Photo by Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images)Allen Berezovsky via Getty ImagesWhen Odom was asked why he was speeding — 8 News Now reported that his SUV was tracked going as fast as 106 mph — he reportedly changed his story multiple times, first noting that he was \"almost home\" and then later saying that he was headed to his friend's house.Odom reportedly followed a similar pattern when he was asked about the last time he consumed marijuana. At one point, he quickly changed his answer from he \"doesn't really smoke\" to saying he \"does not smoke,\" according to the report 8 News Now obtained. Eventually, Odom admitted he smoked \"maybe earlier today.\"The report showed that Odom failed the sobriety tests he was given and then was arrested, per 8 News Now. As of Tuesday, Odom was no longer in custody, per The Associated Press, which cited Clark County jail records. He was booked there on charges of DUI, driving more than 41 miles per hour over the speed limit and failing to maintain travel in a street lane/improper lane change, as reported by USA Today.He has a hearing scheduled for March 17.Odom played for four different NBA teams from 1999-2013 before drug abuse derailed the remainder of the forward's basketball career. It also ruptured his marriage to Khloé Kardashian. An overdose left him comatose for three days in a Vegas hospital when he was found unconscious in a brothel in 2015, although Odom still says he doesn't recall taking drugs that night.Odom was part of the NBA All-Rookie first team with the Los Angeles Clippers, who drafted him No. 4 overall out of Rhode Island in 1999. He became the league's Sixth Man of the Year with the Lakers in 2011 after helping the franchise win back-to-back titles in 2009-10.",

    "content_html": "Golden State Warriors forward Jimmy Butler suffered a torn ACL in Monday's 135-112 win over the Miami Heat. His season is over.Butler's agent, Bernie Lee, confirmed the injury Tuesday. Lee called it a \"gut punch\" and said Butler would \"attack this challenge\" hoping to come back stronger. The Warriors also confirmed the injury later Tuesday and announced that Butler would undergo surgery at a \"to-be-determined date.\"Butler, meanwhile, posted on Instagram stating he would \"be back before you know it.\" [Get more Warriors news: Golden State team team feed]The injury took place in the third quarter at the Chase Center after Butler caught a contested pass in the paint.

They later said Butler would undergo an MRI and didn't reveal any information about the severity of the injury.\"Praying for the best, as far as scans,\" Warriors guard Stephen Curry said, according to ESPN's Anthony Slater.Overnight Tuesday, ESPN's Shams Charania reported Butler was dealing with a torn ACL.Butler previously had two significant injuries to same knee earlier in his career: a meniscus tear in 2018 and an MCL sprain in 2024. Big blow for Butler, WarriorsButler, a five-time All-NBA selection, is in his second season with the Warriors following a midseason trade from the Heat in 2024-25. The Warriors acquired Butler in an effort to compete for another championship on the back end of Stephen Curry's prime. Butler's maintained his high level of play at 36 years old. In 37 games before Monday's, Butler was averaging 20.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.4 steals per game while shooting 51.9% from the field and 38.1% from 3. Curry, meanwhile, is averaging 27.6 points per game and leads the league for an 11th time with 4.5 made 3s per game on 38.6% shooting. He was named an All-Star starter earlier Monday.With Butler and Curry leading the team, the Warriors now hold a 25-19 record, good for eighth place the Western Conference. Butler's ACL tear projects to end any previous long-shot hope of Golden State competing in the West and could impact how the approach the trade market ahead of the Feb. 5 deadline.",

    "description": "A day after the Knicks All-Stars responded to boos at MSG, news broke that Brunson called a players only meeting to address a 2-9 slump.",
    "content_html": "A New York Knicks skid reached what fans can only hope is its nadir Monday in a blowout loss to the hapless Dallas Mavericks at home. This once again — and repeatedly — led to boos from the crowd at Madison Square Garden. And, per ESPN's Ramona Shelburne, it prompted team captain Jalen Brunson to call a players only meeting after the loss. Per the report, Brunson emphasized in the meeting that Knicks players need to look to themselves rather than coach Mike Brown and his staff to fix the problems that have resulted in a 2-9 slump in their last 11 games on the heels of winning the NBA Cup in mid-December. The slump has led to frustration in the locker and among a vocal Knicks fan base.On Monday, boos started to rain from the MSG stands in the second quarter after the Mavericks built a 49-31 lead. The Knicks previously heard boos from the home crowd in the fourth quarter of Saturday's 106-99 loss to the Phoenix Suns. For the second straight night the Knicks hear loud boos from the MSG crowd. pic.twitter.com/EhWBDKCios— KNICKS BEAST (@KnicksBeast) January 19, 2026The Knicks did not respond well to Monday's boos. The Mavericks remained in control of the game en route to a 114-97 win to improve to 18-26, good for 12th place in the West.The slump for the Knicks has dropped them from a 23-9 start to 25-18. That's good enough for third place in the East. But the Knicks are now closer in the standings to the 11th-place Milwaukee Bucks (18-24) than they are to the first-place Detroit Pistons (31-10). And they ended Monday 1.5 games behind the much-loathed Boston Celtics (26-16).Jalen Brunson: 'I'd be booing us too'Brunson and fellow All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns both heard the boos — obviously. And they understand. Brunson finished Monday with 22 points and six assists. But he struggled from the field in a 9-of-22 shooting effort. He was asked about the boos at his locker room postgame.\"I'd be booing us too,\" Brunson said. \"Straight up.\"\"I'd be booing us too. Straight up\"- Jalen Brunson on the boos at MSG pic.twitter.com/XtnkiHkqOT— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 20, 2026Towns posted the best effort by a Knick with 22 points and 18 rebounds, but he committed a team-high five turnovers and five fouls. And he's posted a few duds of his own during the slump, including a six-point, one-rebound effort in a 121-90 loss to the Pistons on Jan. 5.Like Brunson, he understands the boos. And he put himself in the perspective of a fan paying to attend Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day matinee. Karl-Anthony Towns on the boos at MSG directed at him and the team\"You spend $140 to represent your favorite player with a jersey. You come to MLK Day here at The Garden and tickets are 3x the price. I'd be disappointed too\" pic.twitter.com/vrTAznt1mV— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 20, 2026\"You come, you spend, what $140 bucks to represent your favorite player with a jersey?\" Towns said. \"And you come to MLK Day here at the Garden and tickets are twice, three times the price?\"And to come here and spend your hard-earned money, money that you've saved up to bring your family to this game and for us to come here and obviously, not only [not] win — which is disappointing — but not really have a chance. I'd be disappointed, too.\"The fans who spend their hard-earned money, they give us so much love and motivation to go out there. They expect the results. And so do we. The fans are doing their part. And we've got to do our part.\"If there's any solace for frustrated Knicks fans, it's that those are the exact kind of responses you want to hear from star players who just got booed off their home court for another poor showing. But that won't stop the boos. Only winning will.",

    "description": "Golden State&#39;s best-laid plans have gone up in smoke. Is it finally time for a hard reset?",
    "content_html": "Adding Jimmy Butler fundamentally changed who the Warriors were last season — the way they played, the heights they could aspire to, their chances of playing meaningful basketball deep into springtime once again. Losing Butler on Monday to a torn right ACL — a devastating blow that sapped every ounce of sweetness out of Golden State’s fourth consecutive double-digit win — fundamentally changes who the Warriors are this season, and threatens a devastating alteration to who they could conceivably still be in the “fading dynasty” stage of the Stephen Curry/Draymond Green/Steve Kerr era.Let’s start with the obvious: It is extremely, extremely damaging to lose a player as good as Butler, whose teams have either outright won or been demonstrably better in his minutes in every season save the one where he was trying to force his way out of Minnesota.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]Even at age 36, a crisp 15 years and nearly 35,000 NBA minutes into his career, Butler remains one of the league’s best all-around players — a high-efficiency, low-mistake offensive connector; a versatile and disruptive defender; a high-IQ adaptor able to fit neatly into the flow when playing alongside Curry and scale up into a larger, more central role when Steph’s off the floor; a consistently high-floor contributor with few peers at his position.(Grant Thomas/Yahoo Sports illutration)Butler is second on the Warriors in scoring, third in assists and rebounds, and leads them in steals and total minutes played. There are four players in the NBA this season averaging at least 20 points, five rebounds, four assists and a steal per game while making at least half of their shots: Butler, perennial MVP favorite Nikola Jokić, and ascendant All-Star-caliber bigs Alperen Şengün and Jalen Johnson.The advanced stats, as ever, love him: He’s been a top-15-to-20 player this season in the eyes of estimated plus-minus, LEBRON, DARKO, value over replacement player, player efficiency rating, win shares per 48 minutes, box plus-minus and regularized adjusted plus-minus, among other metrics. The Warriors have been 9.6 points per 100 possessions better with Butler on the court than off it this season, according to Cleaning the Glass; among players who’ve logged 1,000 minutes, that’s the 10th-largest on/off swing in the NBA.Butler had averaged just under 22-5-5 on pristine .649 true shooting over the past month prior to exiting early against Miami. He was playing some of the best ball of his career, and with it, the Warriors had started to stabilize: Golden State has won four straight and 12 of its last 16, with the NBA’s second-best record and fifth-best net rating in that span.During that period, the Warriors have outscored opponents by 8.4 points per 100 possessions with Butler on the floor, compared to a plus-4.4 net rating without him. That includes a mammoth plus-12.9 net rating in the 183 minutes that Butler played without Curry, continuing the trend that began last season of Golden State finally being able to not only survive non-Steph minutes, but sometimes actually build a lead while he rested. (Imagine that.)Only one Warriors five-man lineup without Butler in it has played more than 20 minutes together this season; the quintet of Curry, Green, Gary Payton II, Brandin Podziemski and Moses Moody has been outscored by 13 points. That, um, will need to change — as will the general tenor of the non-Steph minutes, which, with Butler lost for the season, threaten to return to disaster time. The Warriors have been outscored by 3.9 points-per-100 this season with neither Curry nor Butler on the floor, posting a dismal non-garbage-time offensive rating of just 105.2 — several sub-basements below what the league-worst attack of the Tyrese Haliburton-less 10-34 Pacers has mustered over the course of this season.Combine that with the degree to which Golden State had struggled to tread water in non-Jimmy minutes even with Steph on the floor — just plus-1.1 points-per-100 over nearly 500 minutes this season — and the Warriors have a pretty gnarly puzzle to solve over the second half of the season if they hope to have any chance of remaining in postseason position.Golden State enters Tuesday’s game against the Toronto Raptors at 25-19, in eighth place in the Western Conference — in line for their third straight trip to the play-in tournament. With Butler in the fold and playing at an All-Star level, Kerr, general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. and Co. could reasonably harbor hopes of erasing the two-game gap between them and the fifth-place Houston Rockets, putting themselves in position to not only avoid the play-in but potentially challenge for home-court advantage in the opening round of the playoffs. Now, though, the Warriors braintrust now has to consider whether it’s likelier that they rise or fall — they’re three games ahead of ninth-place Portland, five games up on the 10th-place Clippers, and 5.5 clear of 11th-place Memphis — and how their internal projections will inform their decision-making ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline.Five days past the NBA’s most closely watched trade eligibility date, Jonathan Kuminga remains a member of the Warriors. Twenty-four hours ago, it seemed likely that Dunleavy would keep beating the bushes in search of a deal that could turn the out-of-favor 23-year-old into something, anything, that could improve the Warriors’ chances of making a deep playoff run. But with Golden State now in desperate need of a wing-sized person capable of putting the ball in the basket, even if it’s not in precisely the way Kerr prefers, and with the most frequently stated reason for shelving Kuminga — effectively, we can’t play three not-really-shooters who need the ball in their hands, and Jimmy and Draymond are better than Kuminga is — does that calculus change?If and when Kerr turns back to Kuminga — which he didn’t on Monday, but which he said could happen in the days and weeks ahead — how might the fifth-year forward respond? It seems like an awful lot, asking someone who has essentially been out of the rotation for two months to suddenly start replicating the production of a top-20 player — especially considering lineups where he’s had to carry the offensive workload without Steph or Jimmy have gotten drilled over the past two seasons. If a reintroduced Kuminga struggles under these adverse conditions, does it become even more difficult to move him for a return of noteworthy value? And if he doesn’t — if he looks great — well, then what do you do with a guy you’ve signaled in every way possible that you’re ready to drive to the airport at the earliest opportunity, but who’s suddenly become a load-bearing column in your current build?The $11 billion question hanging over all of this, in the hours after Butler’s grim diagnosis: Just what is that “current build,” now?The premise behind the Butler trade and subsequent extension was clean, clear and evident to all who observed it. Golden State had lined up the contracts of Curry, Butler and Green to take aim at a title run in 2024-25 and 2025-26, with a possible third in 2026-27, when Green holds a $27.7 million player option. It was an unmistakable declaration of intent: As long as we have Steph playing LIKE THIS, we’re going to go for it.And it worked, and it looked great … until it didn’t. The first run ended in the second round, after Steph hurt his hamstring against the Timberwolves; with Butler’s season now over, the second one appears to have ended before it could even get started. And now, the Warriors find themselves back where they were this time last year: with Curry still playing like this, but without a supporting cast commensurate with the frankly unbelievable level at which he continues to produce.Maybe that gives the rest of Golden State’s roster short shrift. De’Anthony Melton is finally healthy again and playing great. Al Horford’s starting to show signs of coming around. Podziemski’s in the midst of his best run of play of the season. Moody and Buddy Hield are shooting better than 40% from 3-point land over the last month. Maybe they keep rolling, and Kerr’s able to find enough contributions from elsewhere — from rookie Will Richard, from Quinten Post, from Trayce Jackson-Davis, and on, and on — to keep the Warriors in the fight, where they’re forever one Curry flurry from delivering a knockout blow.And maybe the injury doesn’t necessarily preclude one last big comeback run. The average return-to-play following an ACL tear is about 11 months, according to Jeff Stotts of In Street Clothes; that would put Butler’s return somewhere around Christmas, meaning he’d miss roughly the first quarter of the 2026-27 season, giving Golden State a lot of runway to get up to full strength before mid-April. Maybe there are still two real bites at the apple here.Maybe, though, Butler’s injury shakes the Warriors’ faith in the viability of that timeline — in the likelihood that, 14 months from now, a core of a 39-year-old Curry, a 37-year-old Green and a 37-year-old, post-ACL-reconstruction Butler will be good enough to win in the playoffs. If Dunleavy and Co. arrive at that conclusion, they’ll have to decide whether they’re comfortable continuing to ride what they’ve got into the sunset — appreciating that time comes for us all, that best-laid plans sometimes go awry, and that it’s worth allowing the Steph-Draymond-Jimmy core to run its course — or if it’s time to make even more drastic changes to the roster, in service of seeding the ground for the next era of Warriors basketball, whenever that might start.The former path would be perfectly respectable, if not downright honorable. In a world that’s seen the Warriors try to pull off the two timelines plan and let Klay Thompson walk, though, the latter can’t be ruled out. I don’t think that means they’re going to trade Steph in the middle of the night. (Although, y’know: Luka.) I do think, though, it means that just about anything else could be on the table, one fundamental change begetting another.",

    "description": "With the NBA trade deadline two weeks away, let&#39;s sort through the players who have reportedly been in trade talks.",
    "content_html": "Welcome back to the world’s most accurate power rankings, where this week, before the Feb. 5 trade deadline, we are adding a wrinkle, rating 25 “available” NBA players from worst to first.Just how “available” they are is in some question. Giannis Antetokounmpo, for example, may want out, but until he formally requests a trade, the Milwaukee Bucks will be hesitant to grant him one. Others are readily available. Some may only be parted with for the right asking price.But all of them make some sense as trade candidates, given their situations. So, here we are to sort them based upon their talent, their contracts, their fits, their everything. Mostly: Can any of them meaningfully change a team’s championship chances? Here we try to sort them in order, mostly, based on how much each could alter this year’s title picture. Surely you will not argue.(Taylor Wilhelm/Yahoo Sports Illustration)One more thing before we get to the rankings: Karl-Anthony Towns. Is he available? Whispers are growing louder, if only because his New York Knicks are struggling. But I still cannot imagine a world in which the Knicks disrupt their roster — one that remains a favorite to emerge from the East — for anyone but Antetokounmpo. So we will leave him sidelined for now.Honorable mentions: Cam Thomas, Brooklyn Nets; Chris Paul, Los Angeles Clippers; De’Andre Hunter, Cleveland Cavaliers; Malik Monk; Sacramento Kings.25. Jonathan Kuminga, Golden State WarriorsOn Thursday, Kuminga demanded a trade from the Warriors. On Friday, we discussed whether he was even a good basketball player. On Monday, Golden State’s Jimmy Butler tore his right ACL, leaving open a massive hole on the wing. Warriors coach Steve Kerr was asked if he will turn to Kuminga, and in a disheartened voice he said, “Sure. Absolutely.” Audition time, I guess?24. Immanuel Quickley, Toronto RaptorsThe Raptors have canvassed the market, shopping “some of their players, including RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley,” looking to see what value they might find, according to ESPN. Among their reported potential targets are Anthony Davis and Ja Morant. Why a trade partner would want the three years and $97.5 million left on Quickley’s deal is a question to which it would need answers.[Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]23. Kristaps Porziņģis, Atlanta HawksThe Hawks, along with the Raptors, are reportedly among the teams that remain interested in the services of Davis, even after a hand injury that could sideline him through the All-Star break. Any Hawks trade for a high-priced star would have to include the $30.7 million expiring contract for Porziņģis, whose health remains a concern. Get him on the court, though, and he would help.22. Anfernee Simons, Boston CelticsOver the summer, Boston was “still very much willing to talk about Simons” in trade discussions, per longtime Celtics insider Steve Bulpett, even after acquiring the former Blazers guard in July. It makes sense, given Simons’ expiring $27.7 million salary. Boston has two reasons to shop him: 1) to duck the luxury tax or 2) to roll that salary forward for a surprisingly competitive roster. 21. Nikola Vučević, Chicago BullsBecause Vučević is on an expiring $21.5 million salary, longtime trade speculation has only rampedup this season, and Vučević himself might even want a change in scenery. To that end, Bulls coach Billy Donovan said, “I do think he’s invested and committed.” Which may make him even more tradable. The Bulls hold enough expiring money to pursue Davis, a local product.20. Jalen Green, Phoenix SunsWhile Green has not been mentioned in any well-sourced trade rumors, the Suns would almost certainly have to include his $33.6 million salary in any discussion of upgrades to a team fighting for a guaranteed playoff seed in the West. The former No. 2 overall pick has shown flashes as a 20-point scorer, though his defense and an ongoing hamstring injury are reasons for concern. 19. Herb Jones, New Orleans PelicansHerb Jones and Trey Murphy III are among the names the Pelicans are not willing to discuss ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline, per Chris Haynes. But teams will continue to call, so long as New Orleans remains at the bottom of the standings. Jones, a 3-and-D wing who has shot 32% from distance over the past two seasons, signed a three-year, $67.6 million extension in July. 18. DeMar DeRozan, Sacramento KingsThe NBA’s worst-keptsecret: Everyone on the Kings, including Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, are available in a trade, particularly as Sacramento pursues another headliner. The Kings could even be open to a DeRozan-for-Morant swap, so long as it does not cost them much more than Devin Carter, but is that enough to convince Memphis?17. Zach LaVine, Sacramento KingsAs with DeRozan, there is no secret about LaVine’s availability via trade. He is owed $49 million next season, when he will turn 32 years old. He has played four playoff games in 12 years. He has always been an efficient 20-point scorer, even if he cannot defend well and commits almost as many turnovers as he registers assists. It only makes sense that his contract is up for grabs.16. RJ Barrett, Toronto RaptorsLike Quickley, Barrett’s salary — $27.7 million this season and $29.6 million next season — makes for an intriguing match in Toronto’s pursuit of an upgrade, which is another reason why he has been linked to rumors surrounding both Davis and Morant. Barrett holds some value on his own, as the 25-year-old has averaged a fairly efficient 20-5-4 for the fourth-place Raptors.15. Coby White, Chicago BullsRival executives are circling the Bulls, according to ESPN’s Jamal Collier, and they may be more open to trading White’s expiring $12.9 million salary than ever before, per Substack insider Marc Stein. Of course, White is owed a potentially costly contract extension at season’s end. The Wolves are reportedly among the teams weighing whether that juice is worth the squeeze.14. Jarrett Allen, Cleveland CavaliersGiven the mix in Cleveland, with Evan Mobley emerging as a force in the middle, we have long wondered whether Allen would be long for the Cavaliers. Trade consideration subsided last season, as the Cavs won 64 games, but ever since they lost another second-round playoff series and started this season in search of a playoff guarantee, speculation has only resurfaced.13. Tyler Herro, Miami HeatMiami will be linked to whatever superstar becomes available, including if and when the Bucks decide to entertain sweepstakes for Giannis Antetokounmpo. One of the few assets the Heat can offer in return is Herro, a 26-year-old, one-time All-Star and former Sixth Man of the Year. He is owed $33 million in 2026-27. How enticing that is to a team trading a superstar is in question. 12. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets“Ball has grown increasingly frustrated with the organization and is open to a trade away from the franchise,” according to Yahoo Sports’ Kelly Iko. Of course, Ball denied this publicly, saying, “The source wasn’t me, so it’s false info,” though reports ever since have maintained that rival executives are operating under the assumption that Ball is available. Does anyone want him?11. Darius Garland, Cleveland CavaliersAs is the case with Allen in the frontcourt, there is a logjam in Cleveland’s backcourt, where Donovan Mitchell is the premier option. Garland’s impact is somewhat redundant, and the Cavs might be looking to make better sense of their roster. For those interested, though, Substack’s Jake Fischer insists, “I just haven’t heard any credible rumblings about Garland’s availability.”10. Austin Reaves, Los Angeles LakersCredit Lakers superstar LeBron James’ agent, Rich Paul, for entering Reaves’ name into the trade discussion, as he proposed a swap of the Lakers’ 27-year-old guard for Jaren Jackson Jr. Paul is not wrong, either, as Reaves could be owed a near-max contract at season’s end, and any quest for a star partner to James and Luka Dončić would require Reaves’ services in return. 9. Domantas Sabonis, Sacramento KingsAgain: No secret has been made about the availability of Sabonis, LaVine and DeRozan. The Kings are looking to mix things up, once again, and if it costs them their best players, so be it. It is not like Sacramento is winning anything as currently constituted. And Sabonis is capable of a triple-double on any given night, although his defense might dissuade most potential suitors.8. Zion Williamson, New Orleans PelicansWilliamson is among the names the Pelicans have been unwilling to shop, Haynes reported, though he may be the most likely of New Orleans’ targets to be traded, per The Athletic’s William Guillory. The Wizards are reportedly on the list of teams that could be interested at the right price. The right price for the oft-injured forward, though, may not be what the Pels want.7. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies“Everybody in here who knows me, knows I’m a very loyal guy,” insisted Morant. “I got a logo on my back, and that should tell you where I want to be.” Of course, based on everything else we have heard, Morant no longer wants to be on the Grizzlies, and they no longer want him, either. As anticipated, multiple suitors have emerged for Morant, including Miami, though at what cost?6. Trey Murphy III, New Orleans PelicansAnd again: Murphy is among the names New Orleans has been unwilling to discuss. Still, “not completely no on Trey, but a pretty high price tag,” according to The Athletic’s Sam Amick. And it makes complete sense. Murphy (22-6-4 on near 50/40/90 shooting splits) is the exact kind of 3-and-D wing, with the potential for more to his game, that any rival team would want to acquire.5. Michael Porter Jr., Brooklyn NetsIt is unclear how much the Warriors’ reported interest in Porter has changed in the wake of Butler’s injury, as it was even unclear how much Golden State was interested anyhow. Detroit has discussed the idea of dealing for Porter, according to Fischer. We have seen Porter win a title. Surely another contender can convince itself he can help them win, too.4. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesAs the market for Morant unfolds, “there’s a growing thought [among rival executives] that Jackson … could be the next domino to fall at some point,” according to Iko. That thought is widely held about the NBA’s 2023 Defensive Player of the Year. What need would Memphis have for Jackson if the franchise is, as reported, seeking a future-focused package for Morant?3. Anthony Davis, Dallas MavericksDavis’ most recent injury muddied the waters of his trade market, as has every injury he has sustained throughout his career. Atlanta and Toronto both appear to still be interested, but “the cost is most certainly going to be lower than it was even a month ago,” per ESPN’s Shams Charania. Which is why it may be in the best interest of Dallas and Davis to keep the status quo.2. Lauri Markkanen, Utah JazzIt was thought a long shot that Markkanen would remain a member of the Jazz, but Utah exec Austin Ainge insisted that the Finnish forward “hopefully is part of our next team when we’re going up.” Keyonte George’s emergence gives Ainge further reason to believe in a come-up, so any trade of Markkanen would surely cost his suitor “an arm and a leg in years of draft capital.” 1. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee BucksFunny thing about Giannis. He might want out. “I don’t know,” he said most recently, “I take it day by day.” He should want out, since his Bucks are bound for the lottery. But he does not want to ask out, for fear of alienating the fans in Milwaukee, per Collier. So maybe he will let his agent do his bidding. In which case, the league will line up for his services. This is Giannis, after all.",

    "content_html": "Who has been the MVP of the league at the season’s halfway point? Who’s winning the Rookie of the Year race? With every team hitting the 41-game mark, let’s hand out midseason awards.Midseason Most Valuable PlayerMidseason Rookie of the YearMidseason Coach of the YearMidseason Defensive Player of the YearMidseason Sixth Man of the YearMidseason Most Improved Player(Mallory Bielecki/Yahoo Sports Illustration)The Midseason MVP is ...Dan Devine: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder, for many of the same reasons he won last year. Take your pick: the best player on the best team; historically elite individual production that lines up pretty neatly next to Michael Jordan; the driving force behind what profiles as one of the greatest teams of all time; the primary reason OKC has a 5.5-game lead on the rest of the West; the most valuable clutch contributor in the league; first or second in nearly every advanced stat known to NBA nerdkind; and has played 10 more games and about 300 more minutes than Nikola Jokić. It’s a pretty strong damn case.Tom Haberstroh: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Injuries to the other four major candidates — Nikola Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Dončić and Victor Wembanyama — have paved the way for the reigning MVP to repeat. I think Cade Cunningham could make a late-season push, but it’s Gilgeous-Alexander’s award to lose. He’s the best player on the best team and has established himself as the game’s top clutch assassin, scoring a league-high 122 points with the score within five points in the final five minutes.Steve Jones: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The debate will rage on down the stretch, but with an injury to Jokić, the Bucks fighting to get into the play-in and the Lakers slipping down the Western Conference standings, it feels like it’s clearly Gilgeous-Alexander. The consistency he’s brought on the offensive end has continued to power the Thunder to the top of the standings. It will be intriguing to see how hard Cunningham, Wembanyama and Jaylen Brown start to knock on the door. Morten Stig Jensen: Nikola Jokić, Nuggets. Gilgeous-Alexander has played in 10 more games so far, but that advantage isn't quite enough, in my eyes, to overtake Jokić's season. That will change, however, should Joker miss a significant portion of games throughout the rest of the season. If not by him becoming ineligible, then because Gilgeous-Alexander is playing so well that a games-played gap justifies him. Kelly Iko: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Joker can miss only six more games before he’s ineligible due to the 65-game rule — and Cunningham would have a decent argument in any other season (26/10/6 on a team that should win 65 games) — but it’s SGA’s to lose. He’s averaging the highest points per shot attempt of any guard over the past decade (only Steph Curry comes close), OKC has a bottom-five offense without him, and his latest trick — dragging a Thunder team down its starting center and second-leading scorer across the finish line with the NBA’s best record — should be the icing on the cake. The Midseason Rookie of the Year is ...Iko: Cooper Flagg, Mavericks. He still has a ways to go in the efficiency department, but we’re talking about a 19-year-old posting 19/6/4 on a middling Mavericks team. That Dallas is within striking distance of the play-in is remarkable. Flagg has been asked to initiate offense, finish possessions, and defend multiple positions — and he’s taken those challenges with confidence. He’ll need to get to a point where he’s not a sub-30% 3-point shooter, but he’s done enough this season to warrant the award. Kon Knueppel has been awesome, though. Haberstroh: Kon Knueppel, Hornets. What a revelation. Think Klay Thompson or Khris Middleton — but with a higher ceiling. He’s a year and a half older than his former Duke mate Cooper Flagg, so in a sense it’s not too surprising that Knueppel has been more NBA-ready than the No. 1 overall pick. The Hornets found their franchise cornerstone.Devine: Kon Knueppel. He leads the rookie class in scoring on pretty shocking shooting efficiency — 56% on 2s, 43.5% on 3s, 89.4% at the charity stripe. As impressive, in my eyes: The 20-year-old has more than kept the Hornets afloat even in the significant amount of floor time he’s played without load-bearing offensive pieces LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Flagg’s been largely fantastic in a tough set of circumstances in Dallas; ditto for Cedric Coward in Memphis; and VJ Edgecombe has fit brilliantly in in Philly. But Knueppel’s walked into the NBA shooting like an all-time-great marksman, and helped elevate the Hornets to within arm’s reach of the play-in tournament.Jones: Cooper Flagg. It’s hard to ignore the corner Flagg has turned this season and the consistent aggression and confidence he’s brought to the table. Despite the tough start, Flagg leads the Mavericks in total points, rebounds, assists and steals, which speaks to his responsibility on a nightly basis. Flagg has a great feel for when and how to get to his spots. And while Kon Knueppel has been great, Flagg has overcome his circumstances to impact the game every night. Jensen: Cooper Flagg, by a freaking hair. This one is far from over, folks. We have a legit Rookie of the Year race on our hands between Flagg and Knueppel, who looks as if he's going to be one of the league's primary shooters for the next decade-plus. Every ROY race is welcome around these parts, so the fact that we aren't seeing someone run away with this thing yet is extremely enticing. [Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube]The Midseason Coach of the Year is ...Jones: J.B. Bickerstaff, Pistons. One of the more underrated skills for a coach to have is to understand the talent you have, maximize it and get the entire roster to buy in. Bickerstaff has been able to do that, keeping Detroit at the top of the East. The great play of Cunningham is one thing, the growth of Jalen Duren is another, but when you go through the roster you see an identity where everyone contributes. This team defends and believes every night, and whatever expectation you had has been exceeded to this point. Jensen: Mitch Johnson, Spurs. Victor Wembanyama has been in and out of the lineup, and Johnson is relying heavily on a three-guard rotation consisting primarily of players who aren't strong natural shooters. Devin Vassell has also missed time, and when he's played his influence has been somewhat average. Yet the Spurs are winning despite all of that. This group has fully embraced a team-first mentality, and that doesn't happen without a high level of quality in the leadership department. Devine: Jordan Ott, Suns. Everyone’s on their best behavior at media day: swearing that it’s going to develop a culture of relentlessness competitiveness that hinges on accountability and the non-negotiability of playing hard. Everyone says that stuff. The Suns are actually doing it, though — eighth in points allowed per possession, second in steals, third in deflections, tied for fourth in loose balls recovered, fifth in offensive rebound rate, sixth in how frequently they dial up full-court pressure, etc. — and they’re reaping the benefits, sitting at 26-17. The Suns needed a full-tilt spiritual reset in the worst way; Ott has brought it from Day 1.Iko: Mitch Johnson. The Suns have been a revelation and Ott has been at its epicenter, but what Johnson has done is simply too incredible to downplay. I was present when Johnson was introduced by Gregg Popovich and outlined his plan to improve the Spurs on both sides of the ball. The results are clear: They are eighth in offense, third in defense, fifth in rebounding and turnover rate and, more importantly, have learned to play without Wembanyama. The improvement of Stephon Castle, Keldon Johnson’s shapeshifting ability and Dylan Harper’s development all have Johnson’s fingerprints on them as well. Haberstroh: Mitch Johnson. San Antonio hasn’t had the full complement of Victor Wembanyama, De’Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and Dylan Harper for half the season and yet it’s emerged as the second-best team in the loaded West. The first-year head coach has pulled all the right levers and scoffs at your NBA Cup hangover talk.The Midseason Defensive Player of the Year is ...Jensen: Victor Wembanyama. Dear NBA, the games played requirement for awards is officially nuts if Wemby goes his third straight season without winning DPOY, which in about 15 years should probably be named after him. The 7-foot-5 dynamo takes away everything. Shots at the rim, passing in the midrange area, corner 3-pointers, and everything in-between. His athleticism, length, and defensive IQ are all off the charts, and virtually all of his opponents rave about him after games. Come on now. Jones: Victor Wembanyama. His impact on the defensive end of the floor is a massive reason why the Spurs have been able to hang near the top of the Western Conference. A consistent presence in the paint, his weakside help consistently forces offenses to make decisions night in and night out. It’s not just his ability to erase space, rotate or protect the paint, it’s the communication and awareness to ensure he’s consistently in the right spot at the right time.  Haberstroh: Victor Wembanyama. I love that he and Chet Holmgren are going toe-to-toe — or fingertip-to-fingertip — for this award. The edge goes to Wemby for me because this is an individual award. The Thunder defense is elite no matter who steps on the floor. Wemby is the sole reason why the Spurs have a top-five defense in the NBA.Iko: Victor Wembanyama.There is no other player that alters opponents’ offensive game plans more aggressively than him. He’s the reason why the Spurs’ defense is menacing. Teams take the most shots from the perimeter and fewest at the rim when he’s on the floor (I wonder why that is), and don’t even think about getting easy baskets in transition. Devine: Victor Wembanyama. Just 45.4% of Spurs opponents’ shot attempts come in the paint when Wembanyama is on the floor; they convert those shots at league-worst levels when he’s out there. The Spurs allow a microscopic 105.8 points per 100 possessions in his floor time, and 117.4 points-per-100 without him; he is, in effect, the difference between San Antonio defending like the Thunder and defending like the Pacers. There are other reasonable answers — Rudy Gobert in Minnesota, Holmgren in OKC — but to me, the most obvious answer feels like the right one.The Midseason Sixth Man of the Year is ...Iko: Keldon Johnson, Spurs. He is the current favorite to win the award, according to BetMGM, but aside from that, let’s talk about the seventh-year guy who’s had to embody a different role nearly every season. He’s shooting a career-best from 3 (42%) and from 2 (63.3%); he’s among the upper echelon in rebounding rate; and he’s simplified his approach to basketball and seen it pay ultimate dividends for the Spurs. This just feels like a San Antonio year. Haberstroh: Jaime Jaquez Jr., Heat. The NBA leaders in points in the paint are a bunch of All-Stars with the exception of one bench player: Jaquez. The UCLA product has bounced back after a dreadful sophomore slump, nearly averaging 15-5-5 off the bench for a winning team in Miami.Devine: Isaiah Stewart, Pistons. You can just stuff your instant-offense guards and wings in a sack, Mister. Beef Stew is an all-around physical menace who leads the NBA in defensive field goal percentage allowed at the rim, who has turned himself into a credible frontcourt floor-spacer (36% from 3-point range) while also having the best interior finishing season of his career, and who has played a massive role in Detroit’s rise to second in the league in defensive efficiency and the top spot in the East. Stewart makes his impact differently than the kind of high-scoring ball-handlers who typically get this award, but that doesn’t mean the impact he makes is any less forceful, vital or worthy of recognition.Jensen: Keldon Johnson. This guy used to average 22 points per game, but has totally rebranded himself as a complete buy-in guy who does whatever is asked of him. He's rebounding better than ever, taking more shots from around the rim, and moving the ball with intent, all while coming off the bench and embracing his own role. It's a major success story for both him and the Spurs. Jones: Jaime Jaquez Jr. There are a variety of bench players who have really impacted their teams, so this could get even more interesting in the second half of the season. As of now, I salute Jaquez for how he’s helped lift Miami’s offensive attack. A shift to more spacing, more drive-and-kick and more cutting has been helped by Jaquez’s consistent ability to get into the paint and not only finish but showcase improved decision-making. The Midseason Most Improved Player is ...Iko: Deni Avdija, Trail Blazers. It’s hilarious to recall Avdija was the throw-in piece in the Malcolm Brogdon deal; this is a man averaging a stunning 30/7/7 since the calendar flipped to 2026. How do you argue against a fellow who’s been trusted with carrying Portland’s entire offense on his shoulders all while keeping the Blazers in the thick of the play-in? Look no further than the home-and-home against the Rockets for a microcosm of how important Avdija is to winning basketball. Sometimes all you need is a push. Or a trade away from the Wizards. Jones: Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Hawks. There is always a debate on what exactly this award should mean, and there are a lot of names that could be added to the list. There is a world where people point to Jalen Johnson, Jalen Duren and Dillon Brooks for their contributions. Keyonte George, Collin Gillespie and Anthony Black have consistently turned heads. I point to Alexander-Walker. Opportunity is everything, but to go from averaging single digits to 20 points a night is not easy. Haberstroh: Deni Avdija. The Blazers have missed more games due to injury than any team in the NBA, and yet they’re .500 in the West. It’s all because of Avdija, who’s now one of three players to average at least 25 points, six rebounds and six assists this season. It’s him, Luka Dončić and Nikola Jokić. His first All-Star is coming any day now. If he keeps this up — every value metric has him as a top-15 player this season — so should his first All-NBA appearance.Devine: Keyonte George, Jazz. This time last year, George was shooting under 40% from the floor with a too-high-for-a-lead-guard turnover rate while profiling as one of the NBA’s worst defenders. Now, he’s averaging 24 points, 7 assists and 4 rebounds per game, looking like a completely different, more composed and more aggressive offensive player. (He’s even showing — slightly — improved block and steal rates.) Reasonable arguments can be made for making-the-All-Star-leap dudes like Avdija and Duren; here, though, I’ll shout out someone who looked like he might be circling the drain on his way to being out of the league, but has done the work to climb back into consideration as a cornerstone for his franchise.Jensen: Nickeil Alexander-Walker.It's between Avdija, George, and Alexander-Walker for me. I lean toward Alexander-Walker because of that surprise factor. We saw Avdija wrap up 2024-25 on a high note, so this doesn't register as a major surprise. However, George is playing out of his mind, and if Utah had been just a slightly better team, I might have rewarded him for that. There's still time, though.",

The Warriors acquired Butler in an effort to compete for another championship on the back end of Stephen Curry's prime. Butler's maintained his high level of play at 36 years old. In 37 games before Monday's, Butler was averaging 20.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 1.4 steals per game while shooting 51.9% from the field and 38.1% from 3.

He was named an All-Star starter earlier Monday.With Butler and Curry leading the team, the Warriors entered Monday's game at 24-19, good for eighth place the Western Conference.

The Knicks previously heard boos from the home crowd in Saturday's 106-99 loss to the Phoenix Suns. For the second straight night the Knicks hear loud boos from the MSG crowd. pic.twitter.com/EhWBDKCios— KNICKS BEAST (@KnicksBeast) January 19, 2026The Knicks did not respond well to Monday's boos.

He was asked about the boos at his locker room postgame.\"I'd be booing us too,\" Brunson said. \"Straight up.\"\"I'd be booing us too.

And he's posted a few duds of his own during the slump, including a 6-point, 1-rebound effort in a 121-90 loss to the Pistons on Jan. 5.Like Brunson, he understands the boos. And he put himself in the perspective of a fan paying to attend Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day matinee. Karl-Anthony Towns on the boos at MSG directed at him and the team\"You spend $140 to represent your favorite player with a jersey.

I'd be disappointed too\" pic.twitter.com/vrTAznt1mV— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 20, 2026\"You come, you spend, what $140 bucks to represent your favorite player with a jersey?\" Towns said. \"And you come to MLK Day here at the Garden and tickets are twice, three times the price?\"And to come here and spend your hard-earned money, money that you've saved up to bring your family to this game and for us to come here and obviously, not only [not] win — which is disappointing — but not really have a chance. I'd be disappointed too.\"The fans who spend their hard-earned money, they give us so much love and motivation to go out there. They expect the results. And so do we. The fans are doing their part. And we've got to do our part.\"If there's any solace for frustrated Knicks fans, it's that those are the exact kind of responses you want to hear from star players who just got booed off their home court for another poor showing. But that won't stop the boos. Only winning will.",

During the last 14 games, the Clippers have beaten the Lakers, Rockets, Pistons twice, Warriors and Raptors. Leonard was a huge contributor over the past 14 games, leading the team in scoring in all but three of those games, and he didn’t suit up for the win over Toronto on Friday.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"1813b1aff4c94005a955fb752f130da6\"><core-module id=\"1813b1aff4c94005a955fb752f130da6\" type=\"curatedLinks\" title=\"More NBA News\" headerLink=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/\" subheadline=\"\" listid=\"eb86ae4b-e092-459b-a90f-9848764a50fb\"/></p><p>The Clippers have been hot lately due largely to Leonard’s play, and now he’s out again, dealing with a knee injury. LA is turning the season around at the right time, and now their star player will miss at least the last two games of this short road trip. The Clippers will conclude this three-game road trip with games against the Washington Wizards on Monday and the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday.</p><p>Knee irritation might not be a big deal for some players, but with Leonard’s history of knee and leg issues throughout his career, there is cause for concern anytime his knees are mentioned. Due to their recent hot streak, the Clippers have climbed out of the dungeon in the West, but they are still barely hanging on to a play-in spot with a half-game lead over the Memphis Grizzlies in 10th place. The longer Leonard is absent, the more it’s likely to hurt their season an undo all the improvements over the past month.&nbsp;</p>",

The Pistons were the league’s punchline, a team that would scrape together just 10 more wins before the nightmare finally ended. Now, they’re 30-10 and staring down at the rest of the Eastern Conference.</p><p>But the climb is only starting. The next few weeks before the Feb. 5 trade deadline will reveal what Detroit still needs to jump from a great story to an unquestionable favorite. Because when April turns into a possession-by-possession fight, everything starts with who can create offense against a set defense.</p><p>The hardest piece is already in place. The first thing a team needs to contend is a superstar, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/nba-all-star-2026-picking-the-eastern-conference-starters-205711016.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Cade Cunningham has officially leveled up</a> into a genuine All-NBA engine. He’s manipulating defenses with patience, ranking near the top of the league in assists while maintaining three-level scoring and versatile defense.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ED_011625_PistonsTradeDeadline.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ED_011625_PistonsTradeDeadline.jpg\" style=\"height:846px;width:1692px;\" alt=\"(Hayden Hodge/Yahoo Sports Illustration)\" data-uuid=\"c3541701-a588-4a5b-97e6-62bfc5fa55ec\"><figcaption>(Hayden Hodge/Yahoo Sports Illustration)</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>Stars aren’t enough in the modern NBA though. Recent champions and runners-up have been defined by depth. Between smart additions and developmental leaps, Detroit’s supporting cast is strong. Some of it is external. Duncan Robinson’s movement gravity has added a new wrinkle to the offense, while Caris LeVert has provided secondary creation off the bench. But like Cade’s leap, Detroit’s rise is really built on internal growth.</p><p>Jalen Duren belongs in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/first-time-nba-all-stars-whos-a-lock-whos-on-the-bubble-here-are-10-names-to-watch-204738521.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">East All-Star conversation</a> for his violent rim pressure, elite rebounding, and back-line defense. He used to drift in and out of games. Now he looks like the spine of an elite unit.</p><p>That shift has unlocked a second one. Last season, J.B. Bickerstaff barely played Duren next to another big. Duren and Isaiah Stewart shared the floor for only eight minutes. This season, about 25% of Duren’s minutes have come alongside Stewart. And it’s working because Stewart is also playing the best basketball of his life.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://youtube.com/@YahooNBA\" data-i13n=\"slk:Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube;cpos:4;pos:1\"><strong>Subscribe to Yahoo Sports NBA on YouTube</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>Stewart still has a reputation as the “tough guy,” and while that is true, he’s not just a classic interior bruiser. Over the last three seasons he’s a 37% 3-point shooter, which changes Detroit’s geometry when he can space to the line and punish any defender inside. But Stewart’s real gift is on defense.</p><p>Among 107 players who have defended at least 80 isolations this season, Stewart ranks best, allowing only 0.68 points per isolation. That’s one of the most dominant marks in recent years. The Pistons have comfortably let Stewart switch screens onto the likes of Donovan Mitchell and Kevin Durant, and he has the agility to stay connected without bleeding downhill drives.</p><p>If just one of Duren or Stewart is on the floor, the Pistons still have great rim protection thanks to their respective shot-blocking prowess. That lineup flexibility is a big reason the Pistons are second in NBA defensive rating, trailing only the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p><sports-player-card home-or-away=\"\" opposing-team=\"\" week=\"\" stat-list=\"\" player-id=\"nba.p.6703,nba.p.6408\" position=\"C\" stat-time-range=\"2025-2026\" stat-time-range-type=\"season\" stat-type=\"core\" season=\"2025-2026\" meta-data=\"\"/><p>Bench players like Alex Caruso and Aaron Wiggins had big scoring performances in OKC’s run last year, which serves as another example of why true contenders also need players who can light a spark.</p><p>For Detroit, you’d think it would be Jaden Ivey, Ron Holland, or Ausar Thompson, one of Detroit’s former lottery picks. And while each of them has carved out a role, the biggest jolt has often come from Daniss Jenkins, a 24-year-old guard on his second two-way contract after going undrafted in 2024. He’s already had a few “Jenkinsanity” bursts, recently erupting for a 20-point quarter and dishing out a career-high 15 assists. That fearless creation keeps Detroit’s offense from cratering when the starters catch a breather.</p><p>The Pistons certainly check a lot of boxes. And a great start makes fans happy, but it also creates a responsibility for the front office to figure out what breaks in the playoffs before the playoffs break it for you. When teams send two at Cade, is it because Thompson or Holland still can’t consistently make them pay as a spacer? If the ball is forced out of Cade’s hands, can Ivey or Tobias Harris be relied on to make a play? And does this roster have enough shooting to win playoff math? Detroit is 27th in 3-point attempts and 18th in 3-point percentage. That profile can survive in January. But maybe not in April.</p><p><strong>[</strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/teams/detroit\" data-i13n=\"slk:Get more Pistons news;cpos:5;pos:1\"><strong>Get more Pistons news: Detroit team feed</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p><p>All of which brings us to the deadline. The Pistons have the ammo to address any holes. They control a full stash of future firsts, which means they can put four firsts plus three swaps on the table. They also have young players with value (Thompson, Ivey, Holland, Chaz Lanier, Marcus Sasser, and Bobi Klintman). And they have clean salary tools to make any deal work: Ivey is a $10.1 million upcoming restricted free agent, Harris is on a $26.6 million expiring contract, and LeVert will make just over $14 million for one additional season. Between them, other smaller salaries, and their assets, the Pistons can target just about any player.</p><p>Here are eight calls Detroit should make, ranked by impact and fit first, and availability second.</p><p><strong>1. Trey Murphy, Pelicans forward: </strong>Murphy is the cleanest fit for Detroit. He slides into the ecosystem without changing anyone’s shot diet, and his shooting and length raise both the floor and ceiling. At age 25, he also matches Cade’s timeline. The price would be steep (multiple firsts plus youth), but that’s what true two-way wings cost.</p><p><strong>2. Michael Porter Jr., Nets forward:</strong> MPJ is the more extreme version of the same idea. He is not the same defender as Murphy, but he is a more lethal shooter. Put a 6-foot-10 shotmaker next to Cade, Robinson, and Stewart, and defenses start running out of coverages. The Nets would expect a large return for MPJ.</p><div><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:200px;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframely.publishing.yahoo.net/J0KhIu9Z\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen data-embed-domain=\"player.simplecast.com\" data-provider-name=\"iframe\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong>3. Jaren Jackson Jr., Grizzlies power forward:</strong> JJJ is the swing-for-the-fences option. He gives Detroit a third defensive superpower plus a big who can space and close playoff games. Memphis isn’t eager to move him, but given the uncertain state of the team, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/unlocking-a-contender-the-jaren-jackson-jr-trade-market-174324585.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">Detroit should make the call</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Naz Reid, Timberwolves big: </strong>The Wolves aren’t trying to trade Reid. But in theory, he’s the salary that’d have to move if Minnesota makes a big acquisition. And the Pistons previously expressed interest in signing him during his free agency just last summer, so maybe he could find his way to Detroit in some type of three-way deal. With his shot creation, shooting, and contagious energy, he’d be a perfect third big in Detroit’s frontcourt.</p><p><strong>5. Ayo Dosunmu, Bulls guard:</strong> Dosunmu has turned into a real shooter, he can slash into space, and he competes defensively. The Bulls are going nowhere and Dosunmu can be a free agent this summer, so perhaps they’d be willing to cash in.</p><p><strong>6. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Hawks wing: </strong>NAW is making 42.1% of his catch-and-shoot 3s this season and he can do work off the dribble while also providing versatile defense. There&#39;s no reason for the Hawks to move him, especially since he&#39;s on such a team-friendly contract of four years, $60.6 million. But the Hawks seem stuck, and maybe they’d listen if the Pistons are willing to overpay.</p><p><strong>7. Klay Thompson, Mavericks wing:</strong> Klay is quietly having a bounce-back year in less-than-ideal circumstances in Dallas. He still bends defenses with instant-trigger shooting and elite relocation. At $16.7 million this season, he is also the kind of salary you can realistically absorb without detonating the rotation.</p><p><strong>8. Jerami Grant, Blazers wing:</strong> Welcome back! Grant was traded to the Blazers in 2022 following a career year with the Pistons, and he’s still a good player today. He’s a clean fit who can guard wings, hit spot-ups, and punish closeouts as a third option without stealing too many touches from Cade.&nbsp;</p><p><core-module type=\"curatedLinks\" title=\"More NBA news\" headerlink=\"\" subheadline=\"\" listid=\"eb86ae4b-e092-459b-a90f-9848764a50fb\"></core-module></p><p></p><p>Pistons fans who were around for the 2004 championship will remember the Rasheed Wallace acquisition. The Pistons were already a Finals hopeful at 34-22 and third in the East on the morning of the deadline. Chauncey Billups and Rip Hamilton were an exciting backcourt, Tayshaun Prince was having a breakout season on the wing, and Ben Wallace was in the middle of his second consecutive Defensive Player of the Year run. The Pistons were contenders. But the front office recognized that “good enough” wasn’t going to cut it.</p><p>So Detroit targeted Wallace just 10 days after he was already traded to Atlanta, and acquired him for a rotation player and multiple firsts. Wallace came with his warts with a league record technical foul history and a fiery personality that risked disrupting chemistry. And it did, but in a great way. The Pistons finished the year 20-6, as Sheed became a perfect on-court complement and the emotional spark plug that transformed Detroit into a championship unit.</p><p>Today’s Pistons find themselves in a nearly identical headspace. They have the engine in Cade, the defensive foundation in Duren and Stewart, and a newfound culture of winning under Bickerstaff. But how hard do you push? Detroit knows how quickly windows can open and shut. Two years ago, this was the league’s worst team. Now, the Pistons get to decide whether to act like a title team.</p>",
